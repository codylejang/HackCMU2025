    "content": "Walter Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, has been the chairman of CNN and the\nmanaging editor of Time magazine. He is the author of Einstein: His Life and Universe,\nBenjamin  Franklin:  An  American  Life and Kissinger:  A  Biography, and is the co-\nauthor, with Evan Thomas, of The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made.\nHe and his wife live in Washington, DC.\nwww.stevejobsthebiography.com\n\n‘... this is a riveting book, with as much to say about the transformation of modern life\nin the information age as about its supernaturally gifted and driven subject ... In the end,\nwe can’t help but agree with Isaacson’s assessment: “Was he smart? No, not\nexceptionally. Instead, he was a genius”’\nTim Martin, Daily Telegraph\n‘Isaacson’s vivid and beautifully executed book unveils Jobs’s creative process’\nMurad Ahmed, Sunday Times\n‘The book gives the fullest portrait to date of Jobs, depicting him as flawed but\nvisionary. It also provides tantalising clues to the origins of his outsized personality and\nthe company he created’\nFinancial Times\n‘Isaacson’s biography can be read in several ways. It is on the one hand a history of the\nmost exciting time in the age of computers, when the machines first became personal\nand later, fashionable accessories. It is also a textbook study of the rise and fall and rise\nof Apple and the brutal clashes that destroyed friendships and careers. And it is a\ngadget lover’s dream, with fabulous, inside accounts of how the Macintosh, iPod,\niPhone and iPad came into being. But more than anything, Isaacson has crafted a\nbiography of a complicated, peculiar personality – Jobs was charming, loathsome,\nlovable, obsessive, maddening – and the author shows how Jobs’s character was\ninstrumental in shaping some of the greatest technological innovations of our time’\nWashington Post\n‘... a considerable achievement, a thorough and insightful look into the life of Apple’s\nvisionary’\nThe Times\n‘A frank, smart and wholly unsentimental biography ... a remarkably sharp, hi-res\nportrait ...

Sceptic after sceptic made the mistake of\nunderrating Steve Jobs, but he got the last laugh every time. This book makes it all the\nsadder that his last laugh is over’\nJanet Maslin, New York Times\n‘Walter Isaacson has written an enthralling history of the birth of our modern digital\nworld and the company that may have done more than any other to shape it. And, in his\nobnoxious, smelly, ranting, impatient, intuitive, creative and inspirational Steve Jobs, he\nhas presented us with the greatest business genius of the past 30 years’\nRory Cellan-Jones, Management Today\n‘Isaacson’s epic biography joins all the dots in Jobs’s fascinating journey and weaves\nan inspiring – and disturbing – story about the man who was determined to leave his\nmark’\nSydney Morning Herald\n‘If you haven’t read the bestselling, superb biography and inspiring business book,\nSteve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson, do so ... [A] masterpiece’\nSteve Forbes, Forbes\n‘... for the first time sheds light on the fiercely, obsessively private man ... The\nattention to detail is astounding, and this is an encyclopaedic record of Jobs’s life, right\nup to his battle against cancer and death ... Isaacson has produced an honest look at the\nman who has done more to make technology accessible than anyone else on the planet\n... Isaacson is a man who clearly “gets” Jobs, and has provided a fitting legacy to a\nflawed genius’\nMark Prigg, Evening Standard\n‘Making the reader think differently about Jobs is also the secret to the success of\nWalter Isaacson’s extraordinarily detailed and deft authorised biography: even the most\nardent Apple loyalist will be forced to realise that Jobs was, for all his visionary\ngenius, deeply flawed, odd and capricious ...’\nDavin O’Dwyer, Irish Times\n‘This is an authorised but brutally honest account of the life of a legend of our age’\nHerald Sun\n‘Isaacson has done an outstanding job. He keeps a sturdily detached perspective about\nJobs’ many eccentricities. His biographer has written a captivating account of this\ndigital visionary whose products have enthralled millions of people’\nAndrew Rosenheim, Spectator\n\n‘Walter Isaacson’s book is an unflinching biography of a manifestly great man ... Steve\nJobs’s life was a great story with a near mythic arc, and Isaacson captures it well ... the\nbook moves at a fast pace with a great eye for detail ... Isaacson is perceptive and\noriginal’\nCultofMac.com\n‘A memorable biography of the brilliant and maddening man who revolutionised the\nway we work and play.’\nNew Zealand Herald\n‘Even if you have no interest at all in the lives of businessmen, this is worth reading,\nand no surprise it’s the number one bestseller. It’s a – literally – epic story, superbly\ntold by Isaacson with none of the breathlessness of the usual boring hatchet-faced Chief\nExecutive’s Tale. Jobs approved; when, as he was dying, he said he hadn’t read it yet\nbut would there be stuff he didn’t like, Isaacson said yes. “Good”, said Jobs, “then it\nwon’t read like an in-house book”’\nMichael Bywater, Independent\n\nALSO BY WALTER ISAACSON\nAmerican Sketches\nEinstein: His Life and Universe\nA Benjamin Franklin Reader\nBenjamin Franklin: An American Life\nKissinger: A Biography\nThe Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made (with Evan Thomas)\nPro and Con\n\nCopyright\nPublished by Little, Brown\nISBN: 978-0-748-13132-7\nCopyright © Walter Isaacson 2011\nThe right of Walter Isaacson to be identified as the Author of this Work has been\nasserted by him in accordance with the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.\nIllustration credits appear on page 534.\nThe moral right of the author has been asserted.\nAll rights reserved.

He had been scattershot\nfriendly to me over the years, with occasional bursts of intensity, especially when he\nwas launching a new product that he wanted on the cover of Time or featured on CNN,\nplaces where I’d worked. But now that I was no longer at either of those places, I\nhadn’t heard from him much. We talked a bit about the Aspen Institute, which I had\nrecently joined, and I invited him to speak at our summer campus in Colorado. He’d be\nhappy to come, he said, but not to be onstage. He wanted instead to take a walk so that\nwe could talk.\nThat seemed a bit odd. I didn’t yet know that taking a long walk was his preferred\nway to have a serious conversation. It turned out that he wanted me to write a biography\nof him. I had recently published one on Benjamin Franklin and was writing one about\nAlbert Einstein, and my initial reaction was to wonder, half jokingly, whether he saw\nhimself as the natural successor in that sequence. Because I assumed that he was still in\nthe middle of an oscillating career that had many more ups and downs left, I demurred.\nNot now, I said. Maybe in a decade or two, when you retire.\nI had known him since 1984, when he came to Manhattan to have lunch with Time’s\neditors and extol his new Macintosh. He was petulant even then, attacking a Time\ncorrespondent for having wounded him with a story that was too revealing. But talking\nto him afterward, I found myself rather captivated, as so many others have been over the\nyears, by his engaging intensity. We stayed in touch, even after he was ousted from\nApple. When he had something to pitch, such as a NeXT computer or Pixar movie, the\nbeam of his charm would suddenly refocus on me, and he would take me to a sushi\nrestaurant in Lower Manhattan to tell me that whatever he was touting was the best thing\nhe had ever produced. I liked him.\nWhen he was restored to the throne at Apple, we put him on the cover of Time, and\nsoon thereafter he began offering me his ideas for a series we were doing on the most\ninfluential  people  of  the  century.  He  had  launched  his  “Think  Different”  campaign,\nfeaturing iconic photos of some of the same people we were considering, and he found\nthe endeavor of assessing historic influence fascinating.\nAfter I had deflected his suggestion that I write a biography of him, I heard from him\nevery now and then. At one point I emailed to ask if it was true, as my daughter had told\nme, that the Apple logo was an homage to Alan Turing, the British computer pioneer\nwho broke the German wartime codes and then committed suicide by biting into a\ncyanide-laced apple. He replied that he wished he had thought of that, but hadn’t. That\n\nstarted an exchange about the early history of Apple, and I found myself gathering string\non  the  subject,  just  in  case  I  ever  decided  to  do  such  a  book.  When  my  Einstein\nbiography came out, he came to a book event in Palo Alto and pulled me aside to\nsuggest, again, that he would make a good subject.\nHis persistence baffled me. He was known to guard his privacy, and I had no reason\nto believe he’d ever read any of my books. Maybe someday, I continued to say. But in\n2009 his wife, Laurene Powell, said bluntly, “If you’re ever going to do a book on\nSteve, you’d better do it now.” He had just taken a second medical leave. I confessed to\nher that when he had first raised the idea, I hadn’t known he was sick. Almost nobody\nknew, she said. He had called me right before he was going to be operated on for\ncancer, and he was still keeping it a secret, she explained.\nI decided then to write this book. Jobs surprised me by readily acknowledging that\nhe would have no control over it or even the right to see it in advance. “It’s your book,”\nhe said. “I won’t even read it.” But later that fall he seemed to have second thoughts\nabout cooperating and, though I didn’t know it, was hit by another round of cancer\ncomplications. He stopped returning my calls, and I put the project aside for a while.\nThen, unexpectedly, he phoned me late on the afternoon of New Year’s Eve 2009. He\nwas at home in Palo Alto with only his sister, the writer Mona Simpson. His wife and\ntheir three children had taken a quick trip to go skiing, but he was not healthy enough to\njoin them. He was in a reflective mood, and we talked for more than an hour. He began\nby recalling that he had wanted to build a frequency counter when he was twelve, and\nhe was able to look up Bill Hewlett, the founder of HP, in the phone book and call him\nto get parts. Jobs said that the past twelve years of his life, since his return to Apple,\nhad been his most productive in terms of creating new products. But his more important\ngoal, he said, was to do what Hewlett and his friend David Packard had done, which\nwas create a company that was so imbued with innovative creativity that it would\noutlive them.\n“I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics,”\nhe said. “Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said\nabout the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and\nsciences, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do.” It was as if he were suggesting\nthemes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid).\nThe creativity that can occur when a feel for both the humanities and the sciences\ncombine  in  one  strong  personality  was  the  topic  that  most  interested  me  in  my\nbiographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating\ninnovative economies in the twenty-first century.\nI asked Jobs why he wanted me to be the one to write his biography. “I think you’re\ngood at getting people to talk,” he replied. That was an unexpected answer. I knew that I\nwould  have  to  interview  scores  of  people  he  had  fired,  abused,  abandoned,  or\notherwise infuriated, and I feared he would not be comfortable with my getting them to\ntalk. And indeed he did turn out to be skittish when word trickled back to him of people\n\nthat I was interviewing. But after a couple of months, he began encouraging people to\ntalk to me, even foes and former girlfriends. Nor did he try to put anything off-limits.\n“I’ve done a lot of things I’m not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I\nwas twenty-three and the way I handled that,” he said. “But I don’t have any skeletons in\nmy closet that can’t be allowed out.” He didn’t seek any control over what I wrote, or\neven ask to read it in advance. His only involvement came when my publisher was\nchoosing the cover art. When he saw an early version of a proposed cover treatment, he\ndisliked it so much that he asked to have input in designing a new version. I was both\namused and willing, so I readily assented.\nI ended up having more than forty interviews and conversations with him. Some\nwere formal ones in his Palo Alto living room, others were done during long walks and\ndrives or by telephone. During my two years of visits, he became increasingly intimate\nand revealing, though at times I witnessed what his veteran colleagues at Apple used to\ncall his “reality distortion field.” Sometimes it was the inadvertent misfiring of memory\ncells that happens to us all; at other times he was spinning his own version of reality\nboth to me and to himself. To check and flesh out his story, I interviewed more than a\nhundred friends, relatives, competitors, adversaries, and colleagues.\nHis wife also did not request any restrictions or control, nor did she ask to see in\nadvance what I would publish. In fact she strongly encouraged me to be honest about his\nfailings as well as his strengths. She is one of the smartest and most grounded people I\nhave ever met. “There are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy, and\nthat’s the truth,” she told me early on. “You shouldn’t whitewash it. He’s good at spin,\nbut he also has a remarkable story, and I’d like to see that it’s all told truthfully.”\nI leave it to the reader to assess whether I have succeeded in this mission. I’m sure\nthere are players in this drama who will remember some of the events differently or\nthink that I sometimes got trapped in Jobs’s distortion field. As happened when I wrote\na book about Henry Kissinger, which in some ways was good preparation for this\nproject, I found that people had such strong positive and negative emotions about Jobs\nthat the Rashomon effect was often evident. But I’ve done the best I can to balance\nconflicting accounts fairly and be transparent about the sources I used.\nThis is a book about the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a\ncreative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized\nsix industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing,\nand digital publishing. You might even add a seventh, retail stores, which Jobs did not\nquite revolutionize but did reimagine. In addition, he opened the way for a new market\nfor digital content based on apps rather than just websites. Along the way he produced\nnot only transforming products but also, on his second try, a lasting company, endowed\nwith his DNA, that is filled with creative designers and daredevil engineers who could\ncarry forward his vision. In August 2011, right before he stepped down as CEO, the\nenterprise he started in his parents’ garage became the world’s most valuable company.\n\nThis is also, I hope, a book about innovation. At a time when the United States is\nseeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are\ntrying  to  build  creative  digital-age  economies,  Jobs  stands  as  the  ultimate  icon  of\ninventiveness, imagination, and sustained innovation. He knew that the best way to\ncreate value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology, so he\nbuilt a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats\nof engineering. He and his colleagues at Apple were able to think differently: They\ndeveloped not merely modest product advances based on focus groups, but whole new\ndevices and services that consumers did not yet know they needed.\nHe was not a model boss or human being, tidily packaged for emulation. Driven by\ndemons, he could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and\npassions and products were all interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software\ntended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is thus both instructive and\ncautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.\nShakespeare’s Henry V—the story of a willful and immature prince who becomes a\npassionate but sensitive, callous but sentimental, inspiring but flawed king—begins with\nthe exhortation “O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend / The brightest heaven of\ninvention.” For Steve Jobs, the ascent to the brightest heaven of invention begins with a\ntale of two sets of parents, and of growing up in a valley that was just learning how to\nturn silicon into gold.\n\nPaul Jobs with Steve, 1956\nThe Los Altos house with the garage where Apple was born\n\nIn the Homestead High yearbook, 1972\nWith the “SWAB JOB” school prank sign\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nCHILDHOOD\nAbandoned and Chosen\nThe Adoption\nWhen Paul Jobs was mustered out of the Coast Guard after World War II, he made a\nwager with his crewmates. They had arrived in San Francisco, where their ship was\ndecommissioned, and Paul bet that he would find himself a wife within two weeks. He\nwas a taut, tattooed engine mechanic, six feet tall, with a passing resemblance to James\nDean. But it wasn’t his looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweet-humored\ndaughter of Armenian immigrants. It was the fact that he and his friends had a car, unlike\nthe group she had originally planned to go out with that evening. Ten days later, in\nMarch 1946, Paul got engaged to Clara and won his wager. It would turn out to be a\nhappy marriage, one that lasted until death parted them more than forty years later.\nPaul Reinhold Jobs had been raised on a dairy farm in Germantown, Wisconsin.\nEven though his father was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended up with a\ngentle  and  calm  disposition  under  his  leathery  exterior.  After  dropping  out  of  high\nschool, he wandered through the Midwest picking up work as a mechanic until, at age\nnineteen, he joined the Coast Guard, even though he didn’t know how to swim. He was\ndeployed on the USS General M. C. Meigs and spent much of the war ferrying troops to\nItaly  for  General  Patton.  His  talent  as  a  machinist  and  fireman  earned  him\ncommendations, but he occasionally found himself in minor trouble and never rose\nabove the rank of seaman.\nClara was born in New Jersey, where her parents had landed after fleeing the Turks\nin Armenia, and they moved to the Mission District of San Francisco when she was a\nchild. She had a secret that she rarely mentioned to anyone: She had been married\n\nbefore, but her husband had been killed in the war. So when she met Paul Jobs on that\nfirst date, she was primed to start a new life.\nLike many who lived through the war, they had experienced enough excitement that,\nwhen it was over, they desired simply to settle down, raise a family, and lead a less\neventful life. They had little money, so they moved to Wisconsin and lived with Paul’s\nparents for a few years, then headed for Indiana, where he got a job as a machinist for\nInternational Harvester. His passion was tinkering with old cars, and he made money in\nhis spare time buying, restoring, and selling them. Eventually he quit his day job to\nbecome a full-time used car salesman.\nClara, however, loved San Francisco, and in 1952 she convinced her husband to\nmove back there. They got an apartment in the Sunset District facing the Pacific, just\nsouth of Golden Gate Park, and he took a job working for a finance company as a “repo\nman,” picking the locks of cars whose owners hadn’t paid their loans and repossessing\nthem. He also bought, repaired, and sold some of the cars, making a decent enough\nliving in the process.\nThere was, however, something missing in their lives. They wanted children, but\nClara had suffered an ectopic pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg was implanted in a\nfallopian tube rather than the uterus, and she had been unable to have any. So by 1955,\nafter nine years of marriage, they were looking to adopt a child.\nLike Paul Jobs, Joanne Schieble was from a rural Wisconsin family of German heritage.\nHer father, Arthur Schieble, had immigrated to the outskirts of Green Bay, where he and\nhis wife owned a mink farm and dabbled successfully in various other businesses,\nincluding real estate and photoengraving. He was very strict, especially regarding his\ndaughter’s relationships, and he had strongly disapproved of her first love, an artist who\nwas  not  a  Catholic.  Thus  it  was  no  surprise  that  he  threatened  to  cut  Joanne  off\ncompletely when, as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, she fell in love\nwith Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, a Muslim teaching assistant from Syria.\nJandali was the youngest of nine children in a prominent Syrian family. His father\nowned oil refineries and multiple other businesses, with large holdings in Damascus\nand Homs, and at one point pretty much controlled the price of wheat in the region. His\nmother, he later said, was a “traditional Muslim woman” who was a “conservative,\nobedient housewife.” Like the Schieble family, the Jandalis put a premium on education.\nAbdulfattah was sent to a Jesuit boarding school, even though he was Muslim, and he\ngot an undergraduate degree at the American University in Beirut before entering the\nUniversity of Wisconsin to pursue a doctoral degree in political science.\nIn the summer of 1954, Joanne went with Abdulfattah to Syria. They spent two\nmonths in Homs, where she learned from his family to cook Syrian dishes. When they\nreturned to Wisconsin she discovered that she was pregnant. They were both twenty-\nthree, but they decided not to get married. Her father was dying at the time, and he had\n\nthreatened to disown her if she wed Abdulfattah. Nor was abortion an easy option in a\nsmall Catholic community. So in early 1955, Joanne traveled to San Francisco, where\nshe was taken into the care of a kindly doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered\ntheir babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions.\nJoanne had one requirement: Her child must be adopted by college graduates. So the\ndoctor arranged for the baby to be placed with a lawyer and his wife. But when a boy\nwas born—on February 24, 1955—the designated couple decided that they wanted a\ngirl and backed out. Thus it was that the boy became the son not of a lawyer but of a\nhigh school dropout with a passion for mechanics and his salt-of-the-earth wife who\nwas working as a bookkeeper. Paul and Clara named their new baby Steven Paul Jobs.\nWhen Joanne found out that her baby had been placed with a couple who had not\neven graduated from high school, she refused to sign the adoption papers. The standoff\nlasted weeks, even after the baby had settled into the Jobs household. Eventually Joanne\nrelented, with the stipulation that the couple promise—indeed sign a pledge—to fund a\nsavings account to pay for the boy’s college education.\nThere was another reason that Joanne was balky about signing the adoption papers.\nHer father was about to die, and she planned to marry Jandali soon after. She held out\nhope, she would later tell family members, sometimes tearing up at the memory, that\nonce they were married, she could get their baby boy back.\nArthur Schieble died in August 1955, after the adoption was finalized. Just after\nChristmas that year, Joanne and Abdulfattah were married in St. Philip the Apostle\nCatholic Church in Green Bay. He got his PhD in international politics the next year, and\nthen they had another child, a girl named Mona. After she and Jandali divorced in 1962,\nJoanne embarked on a dreamy and peripatetic life that her daughter, who grew up to\nbecome the acclaimed novelist Mona Simpson, would capture in her book Anywhere\nbut Here. Because Steve’s adoption had been closed, it would be twenty years before\nthey would all find each other.\nSteve Jobs knew from an early age that he was adopted. “My parents were very open\nwith me about that,” he recalled. He had a vivid memory of sitting on the lawn of his\nhouse, when he was six or seven years old, telling the girl who lived across the street.\n“So does that mean your real parents didn’t want you?” the girl asked. “Lightning bolts\nwent off in my head,” according to Jobs. “I remember running into the house, crying.\nAnd my parents said, ‘No, you have to understand.’ They were very serious and looked\nme straight in the eye. They said, ‘We specifically picked you out.’ Both of my parents\nsaid that and repeated it slowly for me. And they put an emphasis on every word in that\nsentence.”\nAbandoned. Chosen. Special. Those concepts became part of who Jobs was and\nhow he regarded himself. His closest friends think that the knowledge that he was given\nup at birth left some scars. “I think his desire for complete control of whatever he makes\n\nderives directly from his personality and the fact that he was abandoned at birth,” said\none longtime colleague, Del Yocam. “He wants to control his environment, and he sees\nthe product as an extension of himself.” Greg Calhoun, who became close to Jobs right\nafter college, saw another effect. “Steve talked to me a lot about being abandoned and\nthe pain that caused,” he said. “It made him independent. He followed the beat of a\ndifferent drummer, and that came from being in a different world than he was born into.”\nLater in life, when he was the same age his biological father had been when he\nabandoned him, Jobs would father and abandon a child of his own. (He eventually took\nresponsibility for her.) Chrisann Brennan, the mother of that child, said that being put up\nfor  adoption  left  Jobs  “full  of  broken  glass,”  and  it  helps  to  explain  some  of  his\nbehavior. “He who is abandoned is an abandoner,” she said. Andy Hertzfeld, who\nworked with Jobs at Apple in the early 1980s, is among the few who remained close to\nboth Brennan and Jobs. “The key question about Steve is why he can’t control himself at\ntimes from being so reflexively cruel and harmful to some people,” he said. “That goes\nback  to  being  abandoned  at  birth.  The  real  underlying  problem  was  the  theme  of\nabandonment in Steve’s life.”\nJobs dismissed this. “There’s some notion that because I was abandoned, I worked\nvery hard so I could do well and make my parents wish they had me back, or some such\nnonsense, but that’s ridiculous,” he insisted. “Knowing I was adopted may have made\nme feel more independent, but I have never felt abandoned. I’ve always felt special. My\nparents made me feel special.” He would later bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul\nand Clara Jobs as his “adoptive” parents or implied that they were not his “real”\nparents. “They were my parents 1,000%,” he said. When speaking about his biological\nparents, on the other hand, he was curt: “They were my sperm and egg bank. That’s not\nharsh, it’s just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.”\nSilicon Valley\nThe childhood that Paul and Clara Jobs created for their new son was, in many ways, a\nstereotype of the late 1950s. When Steve was two they adopted a girl they named Patty,\nand three years later they moved to a tract house in the suburbs. The finance company\nwhere Paul worked as a repo man, CIT, had transferred him down to its Palo Alto\noffice, but he could not afford to live there, so they landed in a subdivision in Mountain\nView, a less expensive town just to the south.\nThere Paul tried to pass along his love of mechanics and cars. “Steve, this is your\nworkbench now,” he said as he marked off a section of the table in their garage. Jobs\nremembered being impressed by his father’s focus on craftsmanship. “I thought my\ndad’s  sense  of  design  was  pretty  good,”  he  said,  “because  he  knew  how  to  build\n\nanything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me\na hammer so I could work with him.”\nFifty years later the fence still surrounds the back and side yards of the house in\nMountain View. As Jobs showed it off to me, he caressed the stockade panels and\nrecalled a lesson that his father implanted deeply in him. It was important, his father\nsaid, to craft the backs of cabinets and fences properly, even though they were hidden.\n“He loved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t\nsee.”\nHis father continued to refurbish and resell used cars, and he festooned the garage\nwith pictures of his favorites. He would point out the detailing of the design to his son:\nthe lines, the vents, the chrome, the trim of the seats. After work each day, he would\nchange into his dungarees and retreat to the garage, often with Steve tagging along. “I\nfigured I could get him nailed down with a little mechanical ability, but he really wasn’t\ninterested in getting his hands dirty,” Paul later recalled. “He never really cared too\nmuch about mechanical things.”\n“I wasn’t that into fixing cars,” Jobs admitted. “But I was eager to hang out with my\ndad.” Even as he was growing more aware that he had been adopted, he was becoming\nmore  attached  to  his  father.  One  day  when  he  was  about  eight,  he  discovered  a\nphotograph of his father from his time in the Coast Guard. “He’s in the engine room, and\nhe’s got his shirt off and looks like James Dean. It was one of those Oh wow moments\nfor a kid. Wow,  oooh, my parents were actually once very young and really good-\nlooking.”\nThrough cars, his father gave Steve his first exposure to electronics. “My dad did not\nhave a deep understanding of electronics, but he’d encountered it a lot in automobiles\nand other things he would fix. He showed me the rudiments of electronics, and I got\nvery interested in that.” Even more interesting were the trips to scavenge for parts.\n“Every  weekend,  there’d  be  a  junkyard  trip.  We’d  be  looking  for  a  generator,  a\ncarburetor, all sorts of components.” He remembered watching his father negotiate at\nthe counter. “He was a good bargainer, because he knew better than the guys at the\ncounter what the parts should cost.” This helped fulfill the pledge his parents made\nwhen he was adopted. “My college fund came from my dad paying $50 for a Ford\nFalcon or some other beat-up car that didn’t run, working on it for a few weeks, and\nselling it for $250—and not telling the IRS.”\nThe Jobses’ house and the others in their neighborhood were modeled on ones built\nby the real estate developer Joseph Eichler, whose company spawned more than eleven\nthousand homes in various California sub-divisions between 1950 and 1974. Inspired\nby Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision of simple modern homes for the American “everyman,”\nEichler built inexpensive houses that featured floor-to-ceiling glass walls, open floor\nplans, exposed post-and-beam construction, concrete slab floors, and lots of sliding\nglass doors. “Eichler did a great thing,” Jobs said on one of our walks around the\nneighborhood. “His houses were smart and cheap and good. They brought clean design\n\nand simple taste to lower-income people. They had awesome little features, like radiant\nheating in the floors. You put carpet on them, and we had nice toasty floors when we\nwere kids.”\nJobs said that his appreciation for Eichler homes instilled in him a passion for\nmaking nicely designed products for the mass market. “I love it when you can bring\nreally great design and simple capability to something that doesn’t cost much,” he said\nas he pointed out the clean elegance of the houses. “It was the original vision for Apple.\nThat’s what we tried to do with the first Mac. That’s what we did with the iPod.”\nAcross the street from the Jobs family lived a man who had become successful as a\nreal estate agent. “He wasn’t that bright,” Jobs recalled, “but he seemed to be making a\nfortune. So my dad thought, ‘I can do that.’ He worked so hard, I remember. He took\nthese night classes, passed the license test, and got into real estate. Then the bottom fell\nout of the market.” As a result, the family found itself financially strapped for a year or\nso while Steve was in elementary school. His mother took a job as a bookkeeper for\nVarian Associates, a company that made scientific instruments, and they took out a\nsecond mortgage. One day his fourth-grade teacher asked him, “What is it you don’t\nunderstand about the universe?” Jobs replied, “I don’t understand why all of a sudden\nmy dad is so broke.” He was proud that his father never adopted a servile attitude or\nslick style that may have made him a better salesman. “You had to suck up to people to\nsell real estate, and he wasn’t good at that and it wasn’t in his nature. I admired him for\nthat.” Paul Jobs went back to being a mechanic.\nHis father was calm and gentle, traits that his son later praised more than emulated.\nHe was also resolute. Jobs described one example:\nNearby was an engineer who was working at Westinghouse. He was a single guy,\nbeatnik type. He had a girlfriend. She would babysit me sometimes. Both my parents\nworked, so I would come here right after school for a couple of hours. He would get\ndrunk and hit her a couple of times. She came over one night, scared out of her wits, and\nhe came over drunk, and my dad stood him down—saying “She’s here, but you’re not\ncoming in.” He stood right there. We like to think everything was idyllic in the 1950s,\nbut this guy was one of those engineers who had messed-up lives.\nWhat  made  the  neighborhood  different from  the  thousands  of  other  spindly-tree\nsubdivisions across America was that even the ne’er-do-wells tended to be engineers.\n“When we moved here, there were apricot and plum orchards on all of these corners,”\nJobs  recalled.  “But  it  was  beginning  to  boom  because  of  military  investment.”  He\nsoaked up the history of the valley and developed a yearning to play his own role.\nEdwin Land of Polaroid later told him about being asked by Eisenhower to help build\nthe U-2 spy plane cameras to see how real the Soviet threat was. The film was dropped\n\nin canisters and returned to the NASA Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, not far from\nwhere Jobs lived. “The first computer terminal I ever saw was when my dad brought\nme to the Ames Center,” he said. “I fell totally in love with it.”\nOther defense contractors sprouted nearby during the 1950s. The Lockheed Missiles\nand Space Division, which built submarine-launched ballistic missiles, was founded in\n1956 next to the NASA Center; by the time Jobs moved to the area four years later, it\nemployed  twenty  thousand  people.  A  few  hundred  yards  away,  Westinghouse  built\nfacilities that produced tubes and electrical transformers for the missile systems. “You\nhad all these military companies on the cutting edge,” he recalled. “It was mysterious\nand high-tech and made living here very exciting.”\nIn the wake of the defense industries there arose a booming economy based on\ntechnology. Its roots stretched back to 1938, when David Packard and his new wife\nmoved into a house in Palo Alto that had a shed where his friend Bill Hewlett was soon\nensconced. The house had a garage—an appendage that would prove both useful and\niconic in the valley—in which they tinkered around until they had their first product, an\naudio oscillator. By the 1950s, Hewlett-Packard was a fast-growing company making\ntechnical instruments.\nFortunately there was a place nearby for entrepreneurs who had outgrown their\ngarages.  In  a  move  that  would  help  transform  the  area  into  the  cradle  of  the  tech\nrevolution,  Stanford  University’s  dean  of  engineering,  Frederick  Terman,  created  a\nseven-hundred-acre industrial park on university land for private companies that could\ncommercialize the ideas of his students. Its first tenant was Varian Associates, where\nClara Jobs worked. “Terman came up with this great idea that did more than anything to\ncause the tech industry to grow up here,” Jobs said. By the time Jobs was ten, HP had\nnine thousand employees and was the blue-chip company where every engineer seeking\nfinancial stability wanted to work.\nThe  most  important  technology for  the  region’s  growth  was,  of  course,  the\nsemiconductor. William Shockley, who had been one of the inventors of the transistor at\nBell Labs in New Jersey, moved out to Mountain View and, in 1956, started a company\nto build transistors using silicon rather than the more expensive germanium that was\nthen  commonly  used.  But  Shockley  became  increasingly  erratic  and  abandoned  his\nsilicon transistor project, which led eight of his engineers—most notably Robert Noyce\nand Gordon Moore—to break away to form Fairchild Semiconductor. That company\ngrew to twelve thousand employees, but it fragmented in 1968, when Noyce lost a\npower struggle to become CEO. He took Gordon Moore and founded a company that\nthey called Integrated Electronics Corporation, which they soon smartly abbreviated to\nIntel. Their third employee was Andrew Grove, who later would grow the company by\nshifting its focus from memory chips to microprocessors. Within a few years there\nwould be more than fifty companies in the area making semiconductors.\nThe  exponential  growth  of  this  industry  was  correlated  with  the  phenomenon\nfamously discovered by Moore, who in 1965 drew a graph of the speed of integrated\n\ncircuits, based on the number of transistors that could be placed on a chip, and showed\nthat it doubled about every two years, a trajectory that could be expected to continue.\nThis was reaffirmed in 1971, when Intel was able to etch a complete central processing\nunit onto one chip, the Intel 4004, which was dubbed a “microprocessor.” Moore’s Law\nhas held generally true to this day, and its reliable projection of performance to price\nallowed two generations of young entrepreneurs, including Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,\nto create cost projections for their forward-leaning products.\nThe chip industry gave the region a new name when Don Hoefler, a columnist for the\nweekly trade paper Electronic News, began a series in January 1971 entitled “Silicon\nValley  USA.”  The  forty-mile  Santa  Clara  Valley,  which  stretches  from  South  San\nFrancisco through Palo Alto to San Jose, has as its commercial backbone El Camino\nReal, the royal road that once connected California’s twenty-one mission churches and\nis now a bustling avenue that connects companies and startups accounting for a third of\nthe  venture  capital  investment  in  the  United  States  each  year.  “Growing  up,  I  got\ninspired by the history of the place,” Jobs said. “That made me want to be a part of it.”\nLike most kids, he became infused with the passions of the grown-ups around him.\n“Most of the dads in the neighborhood did really neat stuff, like photovoltaics and\nbatteries and radar,” Jobs recalled. “I grew up in awe of that stuff and asking people\nabout it.” The most important of these neighbors, Larry Lange, lived seven doors away.\n“He was my model of what an HP engineer was supposed to be: a big ham radio\noperator, hard-core electronics guy,” Jobs recalled. “He would bring me stuff to play\nwith.” As we walked up to Lange’s old house, Jobs pointed to the driveway. “He took a\ncarbon microphone and a battery and a speaker, and he put it on this driveway. He had\nme talk into the carbon mike and it amplified out of the speaker.” Jobs had been taught\nby his father that microphones always required an electronic amplifier. “So I raced\nhome, and I told my dad that he was wrong.”\n“No, it needs an amplifier,” his father assured him. When Steve protested otherwise,\nhis father said he was crazy. “It can’t work without an amplifier. There’s some trick.”\n“I kept saying no to my dad, telling him he had to see it, and finally he actually\nwalked down with me and saw it. And he said, ‘Well I’ll be a bat out of hell.’”\nJobs recalled the incident vividly because it was his first realization that his father\ndid not know everything. Then a more disconcerting discovery began to dawn on him:\nHe was smarter than his parents. He had always admired his father’s competence and\nsavvy. “He was not an educated man, but I had always thought he was pretty damn\nsmart. He didn’t read much, but he could do a lot. Almost everything mechanical, he\ncould figure it out.” Yet the carbon microphone incident, Jobs said, began a jarring\nprocess of realizing that he was in fact more clever and quick than his parents. “It was a\nvery big moment that’s burned into my mind. When I realized that I was smarter than my\nparents,  I  felt  tremendous  shame  for  having  thought  that.  I  will  never  forget  that\nmoment.” This discovery, he later told friends, along with the fact that he was adopted,\nmade him feel apart—detached and separate—from both his family and the world.\n\nAnother layer of awareness occurred soon after. Not only did he discover that he\nwas brighter than his parents, but he discovered that they knew this. Paul and Clara Jobs\nwere loving parents, and they were willing to adapt their lives to suit a son who was\nvery smart—and also willful. They would go to great lengths to accommodate him. And\nsoon Steve discovered this fact as well. “Both my parents got me. They felt a lot of\nresponsibility once they sensed that I was special. They found ways to keep feeding me\nstuff and putting me in better schools. They were willing to defer to my needs.”\nSo he grew up not only with a sense of having once been abandoned, but also with a\nsense that he was special. In his own mind, that was more important in the formation of\nhis personality.\nSchool\nEven before Jobs started elementary school, his mother had taught him how to read.\nThis, however, led to some problems once he got to school. “I was kind of bored for the\nfirst few years, so I occupied myself by getting into trouble.” It also soon became clear\nthat  Jobs,  by  both  nature  and  nurture,  was  not  disposed  to  accept  authority.  “I\nencountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before, and I did\nnot  like  it.  And  they  really  almost  got  me.  They  came  close  to  really  beating  any\ncuriosity out of me.”\nHis school, Monta Loma Elementary, was a series of low-slung 1950s buildings four\nblocks from his house. He countered his boredom by playing pranks. “I had a good\nfriend named Rick Ferrentino, and we’d get into all sorts of trouble,” he recalled. “Like\nwe made little posters announcing ‘Bring Your Pet to School Day.’ It was crazy, with\ndogs chasing cats all over, and the teachers were beside themselves.” Another time they\nconvinced some kids to tell them the combination numbers for their bike locks. “Then\nwe went outside and switched all of the locks, and nobody could get their bikes. It took\nthem until late that night to straighten things out.” When he was in third grade, the pranks\nbecame a bit more dangerous. “One time we set off an explosive under the chair of our\nteacher, Mrs. Thurman. We gave her a nervous twitch.”\nNot surprisingly, he was sent home two or three times before he finished third grade.\nBy then, however, his father had begun to treat him as special, and in his calm but firm\nmanner he made it clear that he expected the school to do the same. “Look, it’s not his\nfault,” Paul Jobs told the teachers, his son recalled. “If you can’t keep him interested,\nit’s your fault.” His parents never punished him for his transgressions at school. “My\nfather’s father was an alcoholic and whipped him with a belt, but I’m not sure if I ever\ngot spanked.” Both of his parents, he added, “knew the school was at fault for trying to\nmake me memorize stupid stuff rather than stimulating me.” He was already starting to\n\nshow  the  admixture  of  sensitivity  and  insensitivity,  bristliness  and  detachment,  that\nwould mark him for the rest of his life.\nWhen it came time for him to go into fourth grade, the school decided it was best to\nput Jobs and Ferrentino into separate classes. The teacher for the advanced class was a\nspunky woman named Imogene Hill, known as “Teddy,” and she became, Jobs said,\n“one of the saints of my life.” After watching him for a couple of weeks, she figured that\nthe best way to handle him was to bribe him. “After school one day, she gave me this\nworkbook with math problems in it, and she said, ‘I want you to take it home and do\nthis.’ And I thought, ‘Are you nuts?’ And then she pulled out one of these giant lollipops\nthat seemed as big as the world. And she said, ‘When you’re done with it, if you get it\nmostly right, I will give you this and five dollars.’ And I handed it back within two\ndays.” After a few months, he no longer required the bribes. “I just wanted to learn and\nto please her.”\nShe reciprocated by getting him a hobby kit for grinding a lens and making a camera.\n“I learned more from her than any other teacher, and if it hadn’t been for her I’m sure I\nwould have gone to jail.” It reinforced, once again, the idea that he was special. “In my\nclass, it was just me she cared about. She saw something in me.”\nIt was not merely intelligence that she saw. Years later she liked to show off a\npicture of that year’s class on Hawaii Day. Jobs had shown up without the suggested\nHawaiian shirt, but in the picture he is front and center wearing one. He had, literally,\nbeen able to talk the shirt off another kid’s back.\nNear the end of fourth grade, Mrs. Hill had Jobs tested. “I scored at the high school\nsophomore level,” he recalled. Now that it was clear, not only to himself and his\nparents but also to his teachers, that he was intellectually special, the school made the\nremarkable proposal that he skip two grades and go right into seventh; it would be the\neasiest way to keep him challenged and stimulated. His parents decided, more sensibly,\nto have him skip only one grade.\nThe transition was wrenching. He was a socially awkward loner who found himself\nwith kids a year older. Worse yet, the sixth grade was in a different school, Crittenden\nMiddle. It was only eight blocks from Monta Loma Elementary, but in many ways it was\na world apart, located in a neighborhood filled with ethnic gangs. “Fights were a daily\noccurrence; as were shakedowns in bathrooms,” wrote the Silicon Valley journalist\nMichael S. Malone. “Knives were regularly brought to school as a show of macho.”\nAround the time that Jobs arrived, a group of students were jailed for a gang rape, and\nthe bus of a neighboring school was destroyed after its team beat Crittenden’s in a\nwrestling match.\nJobs was often bullied, and in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an\nultimatum. “I insisted they put me in a different school,” he recalled. Financially this\nwas a tough demand. His parents were barely making ends meet, but by this point there\nwas little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will. “When they resisted, I told\nthem  I  would  just  quit  going  to  school  if  I  had  to  go  back  to  Crittenden.  So  they\n\nresearched where the best schools were and scraped together every dime and bought a\nhouse for $21,000 in a nicer district.”\nThe move was only three miles to the south, to a former apricot orchard in Los Altos\nthat had been turned into a subdivision of cookie-cutter tract homes. Their house, at\n2066 Crist Drive, was one story with three bedrooms and an all-important attached\ngarage with a roll-down door facing the street. There Paul Jobs could tinker with cars\nand his son with electronics.\nIts other significant attribute was that it was just over the line inside what was then\nthe Cupertino-Sunnyvale School District, one of the safest and best in the valley. “When\nI moved here, these corners were still orchards,” Jobs pointed out as we walked in\nfront of his old house. “The guy who lived right there taught me how to be a good\norganic gardener and to compost. He grew everything to perfection. I never had better\nfood in my life. That’s when I began to appreciate organic fruits and vegetables.”\nEven though they were not fervent about their faith, Jobs’s parents wanted him to\nhave a religious upbringing, so they took him to the Lutheran church most Sundays. That\ncame to an end when he was thirteen. In July 1968 Life magazine published a shocking\ncover showing a pair of starving children in Biafra. Jobs took it to Sunday school and\nconfronted the church’s pastor. “If I raise my finger, will God know which one I’m\ngoing to raise even before I do it?”\nThe pastor answered, “Yes, God knows everything.”\nJobs then pulled out the Life cover and asked, “Well, does God know about this and\nwhat’s going to happen to those children?”\n“Steve, I know you don’t understand, but yes, God knows about that.”\nJobs announced that he didn’t want to have anything to do with worshipping such a\nGod, and he never went back to church. He did, however, spend years studying and\ntrying to practice the tenets of Zen Buddhism. Reflecting years later on his spiritual\nfeelings, he said that religion was at its best when it emphasized spiritual experiences\nrather than received dogma. “The juice goes out of Christianity when it becomes too\nbased on faith rather than on living like Jesus or seeing the world as Jesus saw it,” he\ntold me. “I think different religions are different doors to the same house. Sometimes I\nthink the house exists, and sometimes I don’t. It’s the great mystery.”\nPaul Jobs was then working at Spectra-Physics, a company in nearby Santa Clara\nthat made lasers for electronics and medical products. As a machinist, he crafted the\nprototypes of products that the engineers were devising. His son was fascinated by the\nneed  for  perfection.  “Lasers  require  precision  alignment,”  Jobs  said.  “The  really\nsophisticated ones, for airborne applications or medical, had very precise features.\nThey would tell my dad something like, ‘This is what we want, and we want it out of\none piece of metal so that the coefficients of expansion are all the same.’ And he had to\nfigure out how to do it.” Most pieces had to be made from scratch, which meant that\nPaul had to create custom tools and dies. His son was impressed, but he rarely went to\n\nthe machine shop. “It would have been fun if he had gotten to teach me how to use a mill\nand lathe. But unfortunately I never went, because I was more interested in electronics.”\nOne summer Paul took Steve to Wisconsin to visit the family’s dairy farm. Rural life\ndid not appeal to Steve, but one image stuck with him. He saw a calf being born, and he\nwas amazed when the tiny animal struggled up within minutes and began to walk. “It\nwas not something she had learned, but it was instead hardwired into her,” he recalled.\n“A human baby couldn’t do that. I found it remarkable, even though no one else did.” He\nput it in hardware-software terms: “It was as if something in the animal’s body and in\nits brain had been engineered to work together instantly rather than being learned.”\nIn ninth grade Jobs went to Homestead High, which had a sprawling campus of two-\nstory cinderblock buildings painted pink that served two thousand students. “It was\ndesigned  by  a  famous  prison  architect,”  Jobs  recalled.  “They  wanted  to  make  it\nindestructible.” He had developed a love of walking, and he walked the fifteen blocks\nto school by himself each day.\nHe  had  few  friends  his  own  age,  but he  got  to  know  some  seniors  who  were\nimmersed in the counterculture of the late 1960s. It was a time when the geek and hippie\nworlds were beginning to show some overlap. “My friends were the really smart kids,”\nhe said. “I was interested in math and science and electronics. They were too, and also\ninto LSD and the whole counterculture trip.”\nHis pranks by then typically involved electronics. At one point he wired his house\nwith speakers. But since speakers can also be used as microphones, he built a control\nroom in his closet, where he could listen in on what was happening in other rooms. One\nnight, when he had his headphones on and was listening in on his parents’ bedroom, his\nfather caught him and angrily demanded that he dismantle the system. He spent many\nevenings visiting the garage of Larry Lange, the engineer who lived down the street\nfrom  his  old  house.  Lange  eventually  gave  Jobs  the  carbon  microphone  that  had\nfascinated him, and he turned him on to Heathkits, those assemble-it-yourself kits for\nmaking ham radios and other electronic gear that were beloved by the soldering set\nback then. “Heathkits came with all the boards and parts color-coded, but the manual\nalso explained the theory of how it operated,” Jobs recalled. “It made you realize you\ncould build and understand anything. Once you built a couple of radios, you’d see a TV\nin the catalogue and say, ‘I can build that as well,’ even if you didn’t. I was very lucky,\nbecause when I was a kid both my dad and the Heathkits made me believe I could build\nanything.”\nLange also got him into the Hewlett-Packard Explorers Club, a group of fifteen or so\nstudents who met in the company cafeteria on Tuesday nights. “They would get an\nengineer from one of the labs to come and talk about what he was working on,” Jobs\nrecalled. “My dad would drive me there. I was in heaven. HP was a pioneer of light-\nemitting diodes. So we talked about what to do with them.” Because his father now\nworked  for  a  laser  company,  that  topic  particularly  interested  him.  One  night  he\ncornered one of HP’s laser engineers after a talk and got a tour of the holography lab.\n\nBut the most lasting impression came from seeing the small computers the company was\ndeveloping. “I saw my first desktop computer there. It was called the 9100A, and it was\na glorified calculator but also really the first desktop computer. It was huge, maybe forty\npounds, but it was a beauty of a thing. I fell in love with it.”\nThe kids in the Explorers Club were encouraged to do projects, and Jobs decided to\nbuild  a  frequency  counter,  which  measures  the  number  of  pulses  per  second  in  an\nelectronic signal. He needed some parts that HP made, so he picked up the phone and\ncalled the CEO. “Back then, people didn’t have unlisted numbers. So I looked up Bill\nHewlett in Palo Alto and called him at home. And he answered and chatted with me for\ntwenty minutes. He got me the parts, but he also got me a job in the plant where they\nmade frequency counters.” Jobs worked there the summer after his freshman year at\nHomestead  High.  “My  dad  would  drive  me  in  the  morning  and  pick  me  up  in  the\nevening.”\nHis work mainly consisted of “just putting nuts and bolts on things” on an assembly\nline. There was some resentment among his fellow line workers toward the pushy kid\nwho  had  talked  his  way  in  by  calling  the  CEO.  “I  remember  telling  one  of  the\nsupervisors, ‘I love this stuff, I love this stuff,’ and then I asked him what he liked to do\nbest. And he said, ‘To fuck, to fuck.’” Jobs had an easier time ingratiating himself with\nthe engineers who worked one floor above. “They served doughnuts and coffee every\nmorning at ten. So I’d go upstairs and hang out with them.”\nJobs liked to work. He also had a newspaper route—his father would drive him\nwhen it was raining—and during his sophomore year spent weekends and the summer as\na stock clerk at a cavernous electronics store, Haltek. It was to electronics what his\nfather’s junkyards were to auto parts: a scavenger’s paradise sprawling over an entire\ncity block with new, used, salvaged, and surplus components crammed onto warrens of\nshelves, dumped unsorted into bins, and piled in an outdoor yard. “Out in the back, near\nthe bay, they had a fenced-in area with things like Polaris submarine interiors that had\nbeen ripped and sold for salvage,” he recalled. “All the controls and buttons were right\nthere. The colors were military greens and grays, but they had these switches and bulb\ncovers of amber and red. There were these big old lever switches that, when you\nflipped them, it was awesome, like you were blowing up Chicago.”\nAt the wooden counters up front, laden with thick catalogues in tattered binders,\npeople  would  haggle  for  switches,  resistors,  capacitors,  and  sometimes  the  latest\nmemory chips. His father used to do that for auto parts, and he succeeded because he\nknew the value of each better than the clerks. Jobs followed suit. He developed a\nknowledge of electronic parts that was honed by his love of negotiating and turning a\nprofit. He would go to electronic flea markets, such as the San Jose swap meet, haggle\nfor a used circuit board that contained some valuable chips or components, and then sell\nthose to his manager at Haltek.\nJobs was able to get his first car, with his father’s help, when he was fifteen. It was\na two-tone Nash Metropolitan that his father had fitted out with an MG engine. Jobs\n\ndidn’t really like it, but he did not want to tell his father that, or miss out on the chance\nto have his own car. “In retrospect, a Nash Metropolitan might seem like the most\nwickedly cool car,” he later said. “But at the time it was the most uncool car in the\nworld. Still, it was a car, so that was great.” Within a year he had saved up enough from\nhis various jobs that he could trade up to a red Fiat 850 coupe with an Abarth engine.\n“My dad helped me buy and inspect it. The satisfaction of getting paid and saving up for\nsomething, that was very exciting.”\nThat same summer, between his sophomore and junior years at Homestead, Jobs\nbegan smoking marijuana. “I got stoned for the first time that summer. I was fifteen, and\nthen began using pot regularly.” At one point his father found some dope in his son’s\nFiat. “What’s this?” he asked. Jobs coolly replied, “That’s marijuana.” It was one of the\nfew times in his life that he faced his father’s anger. “That was the only real fight I ever\ngot in with my dad,” he said. But his father again bent to his will. “He wanted me to\npromise that I’d never use pot again, but I wouldn’t promise.” In fact by his senior year\nhe was also dabbling in LSD and hash as well as exploring the mind-bending effects of\nsleep deprivation. “I was starting to get stoned a bit more. We would also drop acid\noccasionally, usually in fields or in cars.”\nHe also flowered intellectually during his last two years in high school and found\nhimself  at  the  intersection,  as  he  had  begun  to  see  it,  of  those  who  were  geekily\nimmersed in electronics and those who were into literature and creative endeavors. “I\nstarted to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science\nand technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear.” His other favorites included\nMoby-Dick and the poems of Dylan Thomas. I asked him why he related to King Lear\nand Captain Ahab, two of the most willful and driven characters in literature, but he\ndidn’t respond to the connection I was making, so I let it drop. “When I was a senior I\nhad this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest\nHemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite.”\nOne course that Jobs took would become part of Silicon Valley lore: the electronics\nclass taught by John McCollum, a former Navy pilot who had a showman’s flair for\nexciting his students with such tricks as firing up a Tesla coil. His little stockroom, to\nwhich he would lend the key to pet students, was crammed with transistors and other\ncomponents he had scored.\nMcCollum’s classroom was in a shed-like building on the edge of the campus, next\nto the parking lot. “This is where it was,” Jobs recalled as he peered in the window,\n“and  here,  next  door,  is  where  the  auto  shop  class  used  to  be.”  The  juxtaposition\nhighlighted the shift from the interests of his father’s generation. “Mr. McCollum felt\nthat electronics class was the new auto shop.”\nMcCollum believed in military discipline and respect for authority. Jobs didn’t. His\naversion to authority was something he no longer tried to hide, and he affected an\nattitude that combined wiry and weird intensity with aloof rebelliousness. McCollum\nlater said, “He was usually off in a corner doing something on his own and really didn’t\n\nwant to have much of anything to do with either me or the rest of the class.” He never\ntrusted Jobs with a key to the stockroom. One day Jobs needed a part that was not\navailable, so he made a collect call to the manufacturer, Burroughs in Detroit, and said\nhe was designing a new product and wanted to test out the part. It arrived by air freight\na few days later. When McCollum asked how he had gotten it, Jobs described—with\ndefiant pride—the collect call and the tale he had told. “I was furious,” McCollum said.\n“That was not the way I wanted my students to behave.” Jobs’s response was, “I don’t\nhave the money for the phone call. They’ve got plenty of money.”\nJobs took McCollum’s class for only one year, rather than the three that it was\noffered. For one of his projects, he made a device with a photocell that would switch on\na circuit when exposed to light, something any high school science student could have\ndone. He was far more interested in playing with lasers, something he learned from his\nfather. With a few friends, he created light shows for parties by bouncing lasers off\nmirrors that were attached to the speakers of his stereo system.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nODD COUPLE\nThe Two Steves\nJobs and Wozniak in the garage, 1976\nWoz\nWhile a student in McCollum’s class, Jobs became friends with a graduate who was the\nteacher’s all-time favorite and a school legend for his wizardry in the class. Stephen\nWozniak, whose younger brother had been on a swim team with Jobs, was almost five\nyears older than Jobs and far more knowledgeable about electronics. But emotionally\nand socially he was still a high school geek.\nLike  Jobs,  Wozniak  learned  a  lot  at  his  father’s  knee.  But  their  lessons  were\ndifferent. Paul Jobs was a high school dropout who, when fixing up cars, knew how to\nturn a tidy profit by striking the right deal on parts. Francis Wozniak, known as Jerry,\n\nwas a brilliant engineering graduate from Cal Tech, where he had quarterbacked the\nfootball team, who became a rocket scientist at Lockheed. He exalted engineering and\nlooked down on those in business, marketing, and sales. “I remember him telling me that\nengineering was the highest level of importance you could reach in the world,” Steve\nWozniak later recalled. “It takes society to a new level.”\nOne of Steve Wozniak’s first memories was going to his father’s workplace on a\nweekend and being shown electronic parts, with his dad “putting them on a table with\nme so I got to play with them.” He watched with fascination as his father tried to get a\nwaveform line on a video screen to stay flat so he could show that one of his circuit\ndesigns was working properly. “I could see that whatever my dad was doing, it was\nimportant and good.” Woz, as he was known even then, would ask about the resistors\nand transistors lying around the house, and his father would pull out a blackboard to\nillustrate what they did. “He would explain what a resistor was by going all the way\nback to atoms and electrons. He explained how resistors worked when I was in second\ngrade, not by equations but by having me picture it.”\nWoz’s  father  taught  him  something  else  that  became  ingrained  in  his  childlike,\nsocially  awkward  personality:  Never  lie.  “My  dad  believed  in  honesty.  Extreme\nhonesty. That’s the biggest thing he taught me. I never lie, even to this day.” (The only\npartial exception was in the service of a good practical joke.) In addition, he imbued his\nson with an aversion to extreme ambition, which set Woz apart from Jobs. At an Apple\nproduct  launch  event  in  2010,  forty  years  after  they  met,  Woz  reflected  on  their\ndifferences. “My father told me, ‘You always want to be in the middle,’” he said. “I\ndidn’t want to be up with the high-level people like Steve. My dad was an engineer, and\nthat’s what I wanted to be. I was way too shy ever to be a business leader like Steve.”\nBy fourth grade Wozniak became, as he put it, one of the “electronics kids.” He had\nan easier time making eye contact with a transistor than with a girl, and he developed\nthe chunky and stooped look of a guy who spends most of his time hunched over circuit\nboards. At the same age when Jobs was puzzling over a carbon microphone that his dad\ncouldn’t explain, Wozniak was using transistors to build an intercom system featuring\namplifiers, relays, lights, and buzzers that connected the kids’ bedrooms of six houses in\nthe  neighborhood.  And  at  an  age  when  Jobs  was  building  Heathkits,  Wozniak  was\nassembling a transmitter and receiver from Hallicrafters, the most sophisticated radios\navailable.\nWoz spent a lot of time at home reading his father’s electronics journals, and he\nbecame  enthralled  by  stories  about  new  computers,  such  as  the  powerful  ENIAC.\nBecause Boolean algebra came naturally to him, he marveled at how simple, rather than\ncomplex, the computers were. In eighth grade he built a calculator that included one\nhundred  transistors,  two  hundred  diodes,  and  two  hundred  resistors  on  ten  circuit\nboards.  It  won  top  prize  in  a  local  contest  run  by  the  Air  Force,  even  though  the\ncompetitors included students through twelfth grade.\n\nWoz became more of a loner when the boys his age began going out with girls and\npartying, endeavors that he found far more complex than designing circuits. “Where\nbefore I was popular and riding bikes and everything, suddenly I was socially shut out,”\nhe recalled. “It seemed like nobody spoke to me for the longest time.” He found an\noutlet by playing juvenile pranks. In twelfth grade he built an electronic metronome—\none  of  those  tick-tick-tick  devices  that  keep  time  in  music  class—and  realized  it\nsounded like a bomb. So he took the labels off some big batteries, taped them together,\nand put it in a school locker; he rigged it to start ticking faster when the locker opened.\nLater that day he got called to the principal’s office. He thought it was because he had\nwon, yet again, the school’s top math prize. Instead he was confronted by the police.\nThe principal had been summoned when the device was found, bravely ran onto the\nfootball field clutching it to his chest, and pulled the wires off. Woz tried and failed to\nsuppress his laughter. He actually got sent to the juvenile detention center, where he\nspent the night. It was a memorable experience. He taught the other prisoners how to\ndisconnect the wires leading to the ceiling fans and connect them to the bars so people\ngot shocked when touching them.\nGetting  shocked  was  a  badge  of  honor  for  Woz.  He  prided  himself  on  being  a\nhardware engineer, which meant that random shocks were routine. He once devised a\nroulette game where four people put their thumbs in a slot; when the ball landed, one\nwould get shocked. “Hardware guys will play this game, but software guys are too\nchicken,” he noted.\nDuring his senior year he got a part-time job at Sylvania and had the chance to work\non a computer for the first time. He learned FORTRAN from a book and read the\nmanuals for most of the systems of the day, starting with the Digital Equipment PDP-8.\nThen he studied the specs for the latest microchips and tried to redesign the computers\nusing these newer parts. The challenge he set himself was to replicate the design using\nthe fewest components possible. Each night he would try to improve his drawing from\nthe night before. By the end of his senior year, he had become a master. “I was now\ndesigning computers with half the number of chips the actual company had in their own\ndesign, but only on paper.” He never told his friends. After all, most seventeen-year-\nolds were getting their kicks in other ways.\nOn  Thanksgiving  weekend of  his  senior  year,  Wozniak  visited  the  University  of\nColorado. It was closed for the holiday, but he found an engineering student who took\nhim on a tour of the labs. He begged his father to let him go there, even though the out-\nof-state tuition was more than the family could easily afford. They struck a deal: He\nwould be allowed to go for one year, but then he would transfer to De Anza Community\nCollege back home. After arriving at Colorado in the fall of 1969, he spent so much\ntime playing pranks (such as producing reams of printouts saying “Fuck Nixon”) that he\nfailed a couple of his courses and was put on probation. In addition, he created a\nprogram to calculate Fibonacci numbers that burned up so much computer time the\n\nuniversity threatened to bill him for the cost. So he readily lived up to his bargain with\nhis parents and transferred to De Anza.\nAfter a pleasant year at De Anza, Wozniak took time off to make some money. He\nfound  work  at  a  company  that  made  computers  for  the  California  Motor  Vehicle\nDepartment, and a coworker made him a wonderful offer: He would provide some\nspare chips so Wozniak could make one of the computers he had been sketching on\npaper. Wozniak decided to use as few chips as possible, both as a personal challenge\nand because he did not want to take advantage of his colleague’s largesse.\nMuch of the work was done in the garage of a friend just around the corner, Bill\nFernandez, who was still at Homestead High. To lubricate their efforts, they drank large\namounts of Cragmont cream soda, riding their bikes to the Sunnyvale Safeway to return\nthe bottles, collect the deposits, and buy more. “That’s how we started referring to it as\nthe Cream Soda Computer,” Wozniak recalled. It was basically a calculator capable of\nmultiplying numbers entered by a set of switches and displaying the results in binary\ncode with little lights.\nWhen it was finished, Fernandez told Wozniak there was someone at Homestead\nHigh he should meet. “His name is Steve. He likes to do pranks like you do, and he’s\nalso  into  building  electronics  like  you  are.”  It  may  have  been  the  most  significant\nmeeting in a Silicon Valley garage since Hewlett went into Packard’s thirty-two years\nearlier. “Steve and I just sat on the sidewalk in front of Bill’s house for the longest time,\njust sharing stories—mostly about pranks we’d pulled, and also what kind of electronic\ndesigns we’d done,” Wozniak recalled. “We had so much in common. Typically, it was\nreally hard for me to explain to people what kind of design stuff I worked on, but Steve\ngot it right away. And I liked him. He was kind of skinny and wiry and full of energy.”\nJobs was also impressed. “Woz was the first person I’d met who knew more electronics\nthan I did,” he once said, stretching his own expertise. “I liked him right away. I was a\nlittle more mature than my years, and he was a little less mature than his, so it evened\nout. Woz was very bright, but emotionally he was my age.”\nIn addition to their interest in computers, they shared a passion for music. “It was an\nincredible time for music,” Jobs recalled. “It was like living at a time when Beethoven\nand Mozart were alive. Really. People will look back on it that way. And Woz and I\nwere deeply into it.” In particular, Wozniak turned Jobs on to the glories of Bob Dylan.\n“We tracked down this guy in Santa Cruz who put out this newsletter on Dylan,” Jobs\nsaid. “Dylan taped all of his concerts, and some of the people around him were not\nscrupulous, because soon there were tapes all around. Bootlegs of everything. And this\nguy had them all.”\nHunting down Dylan tapes soon became a joint venture. “The two of us would go\ntramping  through  San  Jose  and  Berkeley  and  ask  about  Dylan  bootlegs  and  collect\nthem,” said Wozniak. “We’d buy brochures of Dylan lyrics and stay up late interpreting\nthem. Dylan’s words struck chords of creative thinking.” Added Jobs, “I had more than\na hundred hours, including every concert on the ’65 and ’66 tour,” the one where Dylan\n\nwent electric. Both of them bought high-end TEAC reel-to-reel tape decks. “I would use\nmine at a low speed to record many concerts on one tape,” said Wozniak. Jobs matched\nhis obsession: “Instead of big speakers I bought a pair of awesome headphones and\nwould just lie in my bed and listen to that stuff for hours.”\nJobs had formed a club at Homestead High to put on music-and-light shows and also\nplay pranks. (They once glued a gold-painted toilet seat onto a flower planter.) It was\ncalled the Buck Fry Club, a play on the name of the principal. Even though they had\nalready graduated, Wozniak and his friend Allen Baum joined forces with Jobs, at the\nend of his junior year, to produce a farewell gesture for the departing seniors. Showing\noff the Homestead campus four decades later, Jobs paused at the scene of the escapade\nand pointed. “See that balcony? That’s where we did the banner prank that sealed our\nfriendship.” On a big bedsheet Baum had tie-dyed with the school’s green and white\ncolors, they painted a huge hand flipping the middle-finger salute. Baum’s nice Jewish\nmother helped them draw it and showed them how to do the shading and shadows to\nmake it look more real. “I know what that is,” she snickered. They devised a system of\nropes and pulleys so that it could be dramatically lowered as the graduating class\nmarched past the balcony, and they signed it “SWAB JOB,” the initials of Wozniak and\nBaum combined with part of Jobs’s name. The prank became part of school lore—and\ngot Jobs suspended one more time.\nAnother prank involved a pocket device Wozniak built that could emit TV signals.\nHe would take it to a room where a group of people were watching TV, such as in a\ndorm, and secretly press the button so that the screen would get fuzzy with static. When\nsomeone got up and whacked the set, Wozniak would let go of the button and the picture\nwould clear up. Once he had the unsuspecting viewers hopping up and down at his will,\nhe would make things harder. He would keep the picture fuzzy until someone touched\nthe antenna. Eventually he would make people think they had to hold the antenna while\nstanding on one foot or touching the top of the set. Years later, at a keynote presentation\nwhere he was having his own trouble getting a video to work, Jobs broke from his\nscript and recounted the fun they had with the device. “Woz would have it in his pocket\nand we’d go into a dorm ... where a bunch of folks would be, like, watching Star Trek,\nand he’d screw up the TV, and someone would go up to fix it, and just as they had the\nfoot off the ground he would turn it back on, and as they put their foot back on the\nground  he’d  screw  it  up  again.”  Contorting  himself  into  a  pretzel  onstage,  Jobs\nconcluded to great laughter, “And within five minutes he would have someone like\nthis.”\nThe Blue Box\n\nThe ultimate combination of pranks and electronics—and the escapade that helped to\ncreate Apple—was launched one Sunday afternoon when Wozniak read an article in\nEsquire that his mother had left for him on the kitchen table. It was September 1971, and\nhe was about to drive off the next day to Berkeley, his third college. The story, Ron\nRosenbaum’s  “Secrets  of  the  Little  Blue  Box,”  described  how  hackers  and  phone\nphreakers had found ways to make long-distance calls for free by replicating the tones\nthat routed signals on the AT&T network. “Halfway through the article, I had to call my\nbest friend, Steve Jobs, and read parts of this long article to him,” Wozniak recalled. He\nknew that Jobs, then beginning his senior year, was one of the few people who would\nshare his excitement.\nA hero of the piece was John Draper, a hacker known as Captain Crunch because he\nhad discovered that the sound emitted by the toy whistle that came with the breakfast\ncereal was the same 2600 Hertz tone used by the phone network’s call-routing switches.\nIt could fool the system into allowing a long-distance call to go through without extra\ncharges. The article revealed that other tones that served to route calls could be found in\nan issue of the Bell System Technical Journal, which AT&T immediately began asking\nlibraries to pull from their shelves.\nAs soon as Jobs got the call from Wozniak that Sunday afternoon, he knew they\nwould have to get their hands on the technical journal right away. “Woz picked me up a\nfew minutes later, and we went to the library at SLAC [the Stanford Linear Accelerator\nCenter] to see if we could find it,” Jobs recounted. It was Sunday and the library was\nclosed, but they knew how to get in through a door that was rarely locked. “I remember\nthat we were furiously digging through the stacks, and it was Woz who finally found the\njournal with all the frequencies. It was like, holy shit, and we opened it and there it\nwas. We kept saying to ourselves, ‘It’s real. Holy shit, it’s real.’ It was all laid out—the\ntones, the frequencies.”\nWozniak went to Sunnyvale Electronics before it closed that evening and bought the\nparts to make an analog tone generator. Jobs had built a frequency counter when he was\npart of the HP Explorers Club, and they used it to calibrate the desired tones. With a\ndial,  they  could  replicate  and  tape-record  the  sounds  specified  in  the  article.  By\nmidnight they were ready to test it. Unfortunately the oscillators they used were not\nquite stable enough to replicate the right chirps to fool the phone company. “We could\nsee the instability using Steve’s frequency counter,” recalled Wozniak, “and we just\ncouldn’t make it work. I had to leave for Berkeley the next morning, so we decided I\nwould work on building a digital version once I got there.”\nNo one had ever created a digital version of a Blue Box, but Woz was made for the\nchallenge. Using diodes and transistors from Radio Shack, and with the help of a music\nstudent in his dorm who had perfect pitch, he got it built before Thanksgiving. “I have\nnever designed a circuit I was prouder of,” he said. “I still think it was incredible.”\nOne  night  Wozniak  drove  down  from  Berkeley  to  Jobs’s  house  to  try  it.  They\nattempted to call Wozniak’s uncle in Los Angeles, but they got a wrong number. It didn’t\n\nmatter; their device had worked. “Hi! We’re calling you for free! We’re calling you for\nfree!” Wozniak shouted. The person on the other end was confused and annoyed. Jobs\nchimed in, “We’re calling from California! From California! With a Blue Box.” This\nprobably baffled the man even more, since he was also in California.\nAt first the Blue Box was used for fun and pranks. The most daring of these was\nwhen they called the Vatican and Wozniak pretended to be Henry Kissinger wanting to\nspeak to the pope. “Ve are at de summit meeting in Moscow, and ve need to talk to de\npope,” Woz intoned. He was told that it was 5:30 a.m. and the pope was sleeping. When\nhe called back, he got a bishop who was supposed to serve as the translator. But they\nnever  actually  got  the  pope  on  the  line.  “They  realized  that  Woz  wasn’t  Henry\nKissinger,” Jobs recalled. “We were at a public phone booth.”\nIt was then that they reached an important milestone, one that would establish a\npattern in their partnerships: Jobs came up with the idea that the Blue Box could be\nmore than merely a hobby; they could build and sell them. “I got together the rest of the\ncomponents, like the casing and power supply and keypads, and figured out how we\ncould  price  it,”  Jobs  said,  foreshadowing  roles  he  would  play  when  they  founded\nApple. The finished product was about the size of two decks of playing cards. The parts\ncost about $40, and Jobs decided they should sell it for $150.\nFollowing  the  lead  of  other  phone  phreaks  such  as  Captain  Crunch,  they  gave\nthemselves handles. Wozniak became “Berkeley Blue,” Jobs was “Oaf Tobark.” They\ntook the device to college dorms and gave demonstrations by attaching it to a phone and\nspeaker. While the potential customers watched, they would call the Ritz in London or a\ndial-a-joke service in Australia. “We made a hundred or so Blue Boxes and sold almost\nall of them,” Jobs recalled.\nThe fun and profits came to an end at a Sunnyvale pizza parlor. Jobs and Wozniak\nwere about to drive to Berkeley with a Blue Box they had just finished making. Jobs\nneeded money and was eager to sell, so he pitched the device to some guys at the next\ntable. They were interested, so Jobs went to a phone booth and demonstrated it with a\ncall to Chicago. The prospects said they had to go to their car for money. “So we walk\nover to the car, Woz and me, and I’ve got the Blue Box in my hand, and the guy gets in,\nreaches under the seat, and he pulls out a gun,” Jobs recounted. He had never been that\nclose to a gun, and he was terrified. “So he’s pointing the gun right at my stomach, and\nhe says, ‘Hand it over, brother.’ My mind raced. There was the car door here, and I\nthought maybe I could slam it on his legs and we could run, but there was this high\nprobability that he would shoot me. So I slowly handed it to him, very carefully.” It was\na weird sort of robbery. The guy who took the Blue Box actually gave Jobs a phone\nnumber and said he would try to pay for it if it worked. When Jobs later called the\nnumber, the guy said he couldn’t figure out how to use it. So Jobs, in his felicitous way,\nconvinced  the  guy  to  meet  him  and  Wozniak  at  a  public  place.  But  they  ended  up\ndeciding not to have another encounter with the gunman, even on the off chance they\ncould get their $150.\n\nThe partnership paved the way for what would be a bigger adventure together. “If it\nhadn’t  been  for  the  Blue  Boxes,  there  wouldn’t  have  been  an  Apple,”  Jobs  later\nreflected. “I’m 100% sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we\ngained  the  confidence  that  we  could  solve  technical  problems  and  actually  put\nsomething into production.” They had created a device with a little circuit board that\ncould control billions of dollars’ worth of infrastructure. “You cannot believe how\nmuch confidence that gave us.” Woz came to the same conclusion: “It was probably a\nbad idea selling them, but it gave us a taste of what we could do with my engineering\nskills and his vision.” The Blue Box adventure established a template for a partnership\nthat would soon be born. Wozniak would be the gentle wizard coming up with a neat\ninvention that he would have been happy just to give away, and Jobs would figure out\nhow to make it user-friendly, put it together in a package, market it, and make a few\nbucks.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nTHE DROPOUT\nTurn On, Tune In ...\nChrisann Brennan\nToward the end of his senior year at Homestead, in the spring of 1972, Jobs started\ngoing out with a girl named Chrisann Brennan, who was about his age but still a junior.\nWith her light brown hair, green eyes, high cheekbones, and fragile aura, she was very\nattractive. She was also enduring the breakup of her parents’ marriage, which made her\nvulnerable. “We worked together on an animated movie, then started going out, and she\nbecame my first real girlfriend,” Jobs recalled. As Brennan later said, “Steve was kind\nof crazy. That’s why I was attracted to him.”\nJobs’s craziness was of the cultivated sort. He had begun his lifelong experiments\nwith compulsive diets, eating only fruits and vegetables, so he was as lean and tight as a\nwhippet. He learned to stare at people without blinking, and he perfected long silences\npunctuated by staccato bursts of fast talking. This odd mix of intensity and aloofness,\ncombined with his shoulder-length hair and scraggly beard, gave him the aura of a\ncrazed shaman. He oscillated between charismatic and creepy. “He shuffled around and\nlooked half-mad,” recalled Brennan. “He had a lot of angst. It was like a big darkness\naround him.”\nJobs had begun to drop acid by then, and he turned Brennan on to it as well, in a\nwheat field just outside Sunnyvale. “It was great,” he recalled. “I had been listening to a\nlot  of  Bach.  All  of  a  sudden  the  wheat  field  was  playing  Bach.  It  was  the  most\nwonderful feeling of my life up to that point. I felt like the conductor of this symphony\nwith Bach coming through the wheat.”\nThat summer of 1972, after his graduation, he and Brennan moved to a cabin in the\nhills above Los Altos. “I’m going to go live in a cabin with Chrisann,” he announced to\n\nhis parents one day. His father was furious. “No you’re not,” he said. “Over my dead\nbody.” They had recently fought about marijuana, and once again the younger Jobs was\nwillful. He just said good-bye and walked out.\nBrennan spent a lot of her time that summer painting; she was talented, and she did a\npicture of a clown for Jobs that he kept on the wall. Jobs wrote poetry and played\nguitar. He could be brutally cold and rude to her at times, but he was also entrancing\nand  able  to  impose  his  will.  “He  was  an  enlightened  being  who  was  cruel,”  she\nrecalled. “That’s a strange combination.”\nMidway through the summer, Jobs was almost killed when his red Fiat caught fire.\nHe was driving on Skyline Boulevard in the Santa Cruz Mountains with a high school\nfriend, Tim Brown, who looked back, saw flames coming from the engine, and casually\nsaid  to  Jobs,  “Pull  over,  your  car  is  on  fire.”  Jobs  did.  His  father,  despite  their\narguments, drove out to the hills to tow the Fiat home.\nIn order to find a way to make money for a new car, Jobs got Wozniak to drive him\nto De Anza College to look on the help-wanted bulletin board. They discovered that the\nWestgate Shopping Center in San Jose was seeking college students who could dress up\nin costumes and amuse the kids. So for $3 an hour, Jobs, Wozniak, and Brennan donned\nheavy full-body costumes and headgear to play Alice in Wonderland, the Mad Hatter,\nand the White Rabbit. Wozniak, in his earnest and sweet way, found it fun. “I said, ‘I\nwant to do it, it’s my chance, because I love children.’ I think Steve looked at it as a\nlousy job, but I looked at it as a fun adventure.” Jobs did indeed find it a pain. “It was\nhot, the costumes were heavy, and after a while I felt like I wanted to smack some of the\nkids.” Patience was never one of his virtues.\nReed College\nSeventeen years earlier, Jobs’s parents had made a pledge when they adopted him: He\nwould go to college. So they had worked hard and saved dutifully for his college fund,\nwhich was modest but adequate by the time he graduated. But Jobs, becoming ever more\nwillful, did not make it easy. At first he toyed with not going to college at all. “I think I\nmight have headed to New York if I didn’t go to college,” he recalled, musing on how\ndifferent his world—and perhaps all of ours—might have been if he had chosen that\npath.  When  his  parents  pushed  him  to  go  to  college,  he  responded  in  a  passive-\naggressive way. He did not consider state schools, such as Berkeley, where Woz then\nwas, despite the fact that they were more affordable. Nor did he look at Stanford, just\nup the road and likely to offer a scholarship. “The kids who went to Stanford, they\nalready knew what they wanted to do,” he said. “They weren’t really artistic. I wanted\nsomething that was more artistic and interesting.”\n\nInstead he insisted on applying only to Reed College, a private liberal arts school in\nPortland, Oregon, that was one of the most expensive in the nation. He was visiting Woz\nat Berkeley when his father called to say an acceptance letter had arrived from Reed,\nand he tried to talk Steve out of going there. So did his mother. It was far more than they\ncould afford, they said. But their son responded with an ultimatum: If he couldn’t go to\nReed, he wouldn’t go anywhere. They relented, as usual.\nReed had only one thousand students, half the number at Homestead High. It was\nknown for its free-spirited hippie lifestyle, which combined somewhat uneasily with its\nrigorous academic standards and core curriculum. Five years earlier Timothy Leary, the\nguru of psychedelic enlightenment, had sat cross-legged at the Reed College commons\nwhile  on  his  League  for  Spiritual  Discovery  (LSD)  college  tour,  during  which  he\nexhorted his listeners, “Like every great religion of the past we seek to find the divinity\nwithin.... These ancient goals we define in the metaphor of the present—turn on, tune\nin, drop out.” Many of Reed’s students took all three of those injunctions seriously; the\ndropout rate during the 1970s was more than one-third.\nWhen it came time for Jobs to matriculate in the fall of 1972, his parents drove him\nup to Portland, but in another small act of rebellion he refused to let them come on\ncampus. In fact he refrained from even saying good-bye or thanks. He recounted the\nmoment later with uncharacteristic regret:\nIt’s one of the things in life I really feel ashamed about. I was not very sensitive, and I\nhurt their feelings. I shouldn’t have. They had done so much to make sure I could go\nthere, but I just didn’t want them around. I didn’t want anyone to know I had parents. I\nwanted to be like an orphan who had bummed around the country on trains and just\narrived out of nowhere, with no roots, no connections, no background.\nIn late 1972, there was a fundamental shift happening in American campus life. The\nnation’s involvement in the Vietnam War, and the draft that accompanied it, was winding\ndown. Political activism at colleges receded and in many late-night dorm conversations\nwas replaced by an interest in pathways to personal fulfillment. Jobs found himself\ndeeply influenced by a variety of books on spirituality and enlightenment, most notably\nBe Here Now, a guide to meditation and the wonders of psychedelic drugs by Baba Ram\nDass, born Richard Alpert. “It was profound,” Jobs said. “It transformed me and many\nof my friends.”\nThe closest of those friends was another wispy-bearded freshman named Daniel\nKottke, who met Jobs a week after they arrived at Reed and shared his interest in Zen,\nDylan, and acid. Kottke, from a wealthy New York suburb, was smart but low-octane,\nwith a sweet flower-child demeanor made even mellower by his interest in Buddhism.\nThat  spiritual  quest  had  caused  him  to  eschew  material  possessions,  but  he  was\n\nnonetheless  impressed  by  Jobs’s  tape  deck.  “Steve  had  a  TEAC  reel-to-reel  and\nmassive quantities of Dylan bootlegs,” Kottke recalled. “He was both really cool and\nhigh-tech.”\nJobs started spending much of his time with Kottke and his girlfriend, Elizabeth\nHolmes, even after he insulted her at their first meeting by grilling her about how much\nmoney it would take to get her to have sex with another man. They hitchhiked to the\ncoast together, engaged in the typical dorm raps about the meaning of life, attended the\nlove festivals at the local Hare Krishna temple, and went to the Zen center for free\nvegetarian meals. “It was a lot of fun,” said Kottke, “but also philosophical, and we\ntook Zen very seriously.”\nJobs began sharing with Kottke other books, including Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind\nby Shunryu Suzuki, Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, and Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism by Chögyam Trungpa. They created a meditation room\nin the attic crawl space above Elizabeth Holmes’s room and fixed it up with Indian\nprints, a dhurrie rug, candles, incense, and meditation cushions. “There was a hatch in\nthe ceiling leading to an attic which had a huge amount of space,” Jobs said. “We took\npsychedelic drugs there sometimes, but mainly we just meditated.”\nJobs’s engagement with Eastern spirituality, and especially Zen Buddhism, was not\njust some passing fancy or youthful dabbling. He embraced it with his typical intensity,\nand it became deeply ingrained in his personality. “Steve is very much Zen,” said\nKottke. “It was a deep influence. You see it in his whole approach of stark, minimalist\naesthetics, intense focus.” Jobs also became deeply influenced by the emphasis that\nBuddhism places on intuition. “I began to realize that an intuitive understanding and\nconsciousness  was  more  significant  than  abstract  thinking  and  intellectual  logical\nanalysis,” he later said. His intensity, however, made it difficult for him to achieve inner\npeace; his Zen awareness was not accompanied by an excess of calm, peace of mind, or\ninterpersonal mellowness.\nHe and Kottke enjoyed playing a nineteenth-century German variant of chess called\nKriegspiel, in which the players sit back-to-back; each has his own board and pieces\nand cannot see those of his opponent. A moderator informs them if a move they want to\nmake is legal or illegal, and they have to try to figure out where their opponent’s pieces\nare. “The wildest game I played with them was during a lashing rainstorm sitting by the\nfireside,” recalled Holmes, who served as moderator. “They were tripping on acid.\nThey were moving so fast I could barely keep up with them.”\nAnother book that deeply influenced Jobs during his freshman year was Diet for a\nSmall  Planet  by  Frances  Moore  Lappé,  which  extolled  the  personal  and  planetary\nbenefits of vegetarianism. “That’s when I swore off meat pretty much for good,” he\nrecalled. But the book also reinforced his tendency to embrace extreme diets, which\nincluded purges, fasts, or eating only one or two foods, such as carrots or apples, for\nweeks on end.\n\nJobs and Kottke became serious vegetarians during their freshman year. “Steve got\ninto it even more than I did,” said Kottke. “He was living off Roman Meal cereal.”\nThey would go shopping at a farmers’ co-op, where Jobs would buy a box of cereal,\nwhich would last a week, and other bulk health food. “He would buy flats of dates and\nalmonds and lots of carrots, and he got a Champion juicer and we’d make carrot juice\nand carrot salads. There is a story about Steve turning orange from eating so many\ncarrots, and there is some truth to that.” Friends remember him having, at times, a\nsunset-like orange hue.\nJobs’s dietary habits became even more obsessive when he read Mucusless Diet\nHealing  System  by  Arnold  Ehret,  an  early  twentieth-century  German-born  nutrition\nfanatic. He believed in eating nothing but fruits and starchless vegetables, which he said\nprevented the body from forming harmful mucus, and he advocated cleansing the body\nregularly through prolonged fasts. That meant the end of even Roman Meal cereal—or\nany bread, grains, or milk. Jobs began warning friends of the mucus dangers lurking in\ntheir bagels. “I got into it in my typical nutso way,” he said. At one point he and Kottke\nwent for an entire week eating only apples, and then Jobs began to try even purer fasts.\nHe started with two-day fasts, and eventually tried to stretch them to a week or more,\nbreaking them carefully with large amounts of water and leafy vegetables. “After a\nweek you start to feel fantastic,” he said. “You get a ton of vitality from not having to\ndigest all this food. I was in great shape. I felt I could get up and walk to San Francisco\nanytime I wanted.”\nVegetarianism and Zen Buddhism, meditation and spirituality, acid and rock—Jobs\nrolled together, in an amped-up way, the multiple impulses that were hallmarks of the\nenlightenment-seeking campus subculture of the era. And even though he barely indulged\nit at Reed, there was still an undercurrent of electronic geekiness in his soul that would\nsomeday combine surprisingly well with the rest of the mix.\nRobert Friedland\nIn order to raise some cash one day, Jobs decided to sell his IBM Selectric typewriter.\nHe walked into the room of the student who had offered to buy it only to discover that\nhe was having sex with his girlfriend. Jobs started to leave, but the student invited him\nto take a seat and wait while they finished. “I thought, ‘This is kind of far out,’” Jobs\nlater recalled. And thus began his relationship with Robert Friedland, one of the few\npeople in Jobs’s life who were able to mesmerize him. He adopted some of Friedland’s\ncharismatic traits and for a few years treated him almost like a guru—until he began to\nsee him as a charlatan.\nFriedland was four years older than Jobs, but still an undergraduate. The son of an\nAuschwitz survivor who became a prosperous Chicago architect, he had originally gone\n\nto Bowdoin, a liberal arts college in Maine. But while a sophomore, he was arrested\nfor possession of 24,000 tablets of LSD worth $125,000. The local newspaper pictured\nhim with shoulder-length wavy blond hair smiling at the photographers as he was led\naway. He was sentenced to two years at a federal prison in Virginia, from which he was\nparoled in 1972. That fall he headed off to Reed, where he immediately ran for student\nbody  president,  saying  that  he  needed  to  clear  his  name  from  the  “miscarriage  of\njustice” he had suffered. He won.\nFriedland had heard Baba Ram Dass, the author of Be Here Now, give a speech in\nBoston, and like Jobs and Kottke had gotten deeply into Eastern spirituality. During the\nsummer of 1973, he traveled to India to meet Ram Dass’s Hindu guru, Neem Karoli\nBaba, famously known to his many followers as Maharaj-ji. When he returned that fall,\nFriedland had taken a spiritual name and walked around in sandals and flowing Indian\nrobes. He had a room off campus, above a garage, and Jobs would go there many\nafternoons to seek him out. He was entranced by the apparent intensity of Friedland’s\nconviction that a state of enlightenment truly existed and could be attained. “He turned\nme on to a different level of consciousness,” Jobs said.\nFriedland  found  Jobs  fascinating  as  well.  “He  was  always  walking  around\nbarefoot,” he later told a reporter. “The thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever\nhe was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.” Jobs had honed\nhis trick of using stares and silences to master other people. “One of his numbers was to\nstare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into their fucking eyeballs, ask\nsome  question,  and  would  want  a  response  without  the  other  person  averting  their\neyes.”\nAccording to Kottke, some of Jobs’s personality traits—including a few that lasted\nthroughout  his  career—were  borrowed  from  Friedland.  “Friedland  taught  Steve  the\nreality distortion field,” said Kottke. “He was charismatic and a bit of a con man and\ncould bend situations to his very strong will. He was mercurial, sure of himself, a little\ndictatorial. Steve admired that, and he became more like that after spending time with\nRobert.”\nJobs also absorbed how Friedland made himself the center of attention. “Robert was\nvery much an outgoing, charismatic guy, a real salesman,” Kottke recalled. “When I first\nmet Steve he was shy and self-effacing, a very private guy. I think Robert taught him a\nlot about selling, about coming out of his shell, of opening up and taking charge of a\nsituation.” Friedland projected a high-wattage aura. “He would walk into a room and\nyou would instantly notice him. Steve was the absolute opposite when he came to Reed.\nAfter he spent time with Robert, some of it started to rub off.”\nOn Sunday evenings Jobs and Friedland would go to the Hare Krishna temple on the\nwestern edge of Portland, often with Kottke and Holmes in tow. They would dance and\nsing songs at the top of their lungs. “We would work ourselves into an ecstatic frenzy,”\nHolmes  recalled.  “Robert  would  go  insane  and  dance  like  crazy.  Steve  was  more\n\nsubdued, as if he was embarrassed to let loose.” Then they would be treated to paper\nplates piled high with vegetarian food.\nFriedland had stewardship of a 220-acre apple farm, about forty miles southwest of\nPortland, that was owned by an eccentric millionaire uncle from Switzerland named\nMarcel Müller. After Friedland became involved with Eastern spirituality, he turned it\ninto a commune called the All One Farm, and Jobs would spend weekends there with\nKottke, Holmes, and like-minded seekers of enlightenment. The farm had a main house,\na large barn, and a garden shed, where Kottke and Holmes slept. Jobs took on the task\nof pruning the Gravenstein apple trees. “Steve ran the apple orchard,” said Friedland.\n“We were in the organic cider business. Steve’s job was to lead a crew of freaks to\nprune the orchard and whip it back into shape.”\nMonks  and  disciples  from  the  Hare  Krishna  temple  would  come  and  prepare\nvegetarian feasts redolent of cumin, coriander, and turmeric. “Steve would be starving\nwhen he arrived, and he would stuff himself,” Holmes recalled. “Then he would go and\npurge. For years I thought he was bulimic. It was very upsetting, because we had gone\nto all that trouble of creating these feasts, and he couldn’t hold it down.”\nJobs was also beginning to have a little trouble stomaching Friedland’s cult leader\nstyle. “Perhaps he saw a little bit too much of Robert in himself,” said Kottke. Although\nthe commune was supposed to be a refuge from materialism, Friedland began operating\nit more as a business; his followers were told to chop and sell firewood, make apple\npresses and wood stoves, and engage in other commercial endeavors for which they\nwere not paid. One night Jobs slept under the table in the kitchen and was amused to\nnotice that people kept coming in and stealing each other’s food from the refrigerator.\nCommunal economics were not for him. “It started to get very materialistic,” Jobs\nrecalled. “Everybody got the idea they were working very hard for Robert’s farm, and\none by one they started to leave. I got pretty sick of it.”\nMany years later, after Friedland had become a billionaire copper and gold mining\nexecutive—working out of Vancouver, Singapore, and Mongolia—I met him for drinks\nin New York. That evening I emailed Jobs and mentioned my encounter. He telephoned\nme from California within an hour and warned me against listening to Friedland. He\nsaid that when Friedland was in trouble because of environmental damage caused by\nsome of his mines, he had tried to contact Jobs to intervene with Bill Clinton, but Jobs\nhad not responded. “Robert always portrayed himself as a spiritual person, but he\ncrossed the line from being charismatic to being a con man,” Jobs said. “It was a\nstrange thing to have one of the spiritual people in your young life turn out to be,\nsymbolically and in reality, a gold miner.”\n... Drop Out\n\nJobs quickly became bored with college. He liked being at Reed, just not taking the\nrequired classes. In fact he was surprised when he found out that, for all of its hippie\naura, there were strict course requirements. When Wozniak came to visit, Jobs waved\nhis schedule at him and complained, “They are making me take all these courses.” Woz\nreplied, “Yes, that’s what they do in college.” Jobs refused to go to the classes he was\nassigned and instead went to the ones he wanted, such as a dance class where he could\nenjoy both the creativity and the chance to meet girls. “I would never have refused to\ntake the courses you were supposed to, that’s a difference in our personality,” Wozniak\nmarveled.\nJobs also began to feel guilty, he later said, about spending so much of his parents’\nmoney on an education that did not seem worthwhile. “All of my working-class parents’\nsavings  were  being  spent  on  my  college  tuition,”  he  recounted  in  a  famous\ncommencement address at Stanford. “I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and\nno idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of\nthe money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that\nit would all work out okay.”\nHe didn’t actually want to leave Reed; he just wanted to quit paying tuition and\ntaking classes that didn’t interest him. Remarkably, Reed tolerated that. “He had a very\ninquiring mind that was enormously attractive,” said the dean of students, Jack Dudman.\n“He  refused  to  accept  automatically  received  truths,  and  he  wanted  to  examine\neverything himself.” Dudman allowed Jobs to audit classes and stay with friends in the\ndorms even after he stopped paying tuition.\n“The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest\nme, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting,” he said. Among them\nwas a calligraphy class that appealed to him after he saw posters on campus that were\nbeautifully drawn. “I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the\namount  of  space  between  different  letter  combinations,  about  what  makes  great\ntypography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science\ncan’t capture, and I found it fascinating.”\nIt  was  yet  another  example  of  Jobs  consciously  positioning  himself  at  the\nintersection of the arts and technology. In all of his products, technology would be\nmarried to great design, elegance, human touches, and even romance. He would be in\nthe fore of pushing friendly graphical user interfaces. The calligraphy course would\nbecome iconic in that regard. “If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,\nthe Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And\nsince Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have\nthem.”\nIn the meantime Jobs eked out a bohemian existence on the fringes of Reed. He went\nbarefoot most of the time, wearing sandals when it snowed. Elizabeth Holmes made\nmeals for him, trying to keep up with his obsessive diets. He returned soda bottles for\nspare change, continued his treks to the free Sunday dinners at the Hare Krishna temple,\n\nand wore a down jacket in the heatless garage apartment he rented for $20 a month.\nWhen he needed money, he found work at the psychology department lab maintaining the\nelectronic  equipment  that  was  used  for  animal  behavior  experiments.  Occasionally\nChrisann Brennan would come to visit. Their relationship sputtered along erratically.\nBut  mostly  he  tended  to  the  stirrings  of  his  own  soul  and  personal  quest  for\nenlightenment.\n“I came of age at a magical time,” he reflected later. “Our consciousness was raised\nby Zen, and also by LSD.” Even later in life he would credit psychedelic drugs for\nmaking him more enlightened. “Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most\nimportant things in my life. LSD shows you that there’s another side to the coin, and you\ncan’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what\nwas important—creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into\nthe stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.”\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nATARI AND INDIA\nZen and the Art of Game Design\nAtari\nIn February 1974, after eighteen months of hanging around Reed, Jobs decided to move\nback to his parents’ home in Los Altos and look for a job. It was not a difficult search.\nAt peak times during the 1970s, the classified section of the San Jose Mercury carried\nup to sixty pages of technology help-wanted ads. One of those caught Jobs’s eye. “Have\nfun, make money,” it said. That day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video game\nmanufacturer Atari and told the personnel director, who was startled by his unkempt\nhair and attire, that he wouldn’t leave until they gave him a job.\nAtari’s  founder  was  a  burly  entrepreneur  named  Nolan  Bushnell,  who  was  a\ncharismatic  visionary  with  a  nice  touch  of  showmanship  in  him—in  other  words,\nanother role model waiting to be emulated. After he became famous, he briefly sported\na Rolls-Royce and occasionally held staff meetings in a hot tub while his staff smoked\ndope. As Friedland had done and as Jobs would learn to do, he was able to turn charm\ninto a cunning force, to cajole and distort reality with the power of his personality. His\nchief engineer was Al Alcorn, beefy and jovial and a bit more grounded, the house\ngrown-up trying to implement the vision and curb the enthusiasms of Bushnell. Their big\nhit thus far was a video game called Pong, in which two players tried to volley a blip\non a screen with two movable lines that acted as paddles. (If you’re under thirty, ask\nyour parents.)\nWhen Jobs arrived in the Atari lobby wearing sandals and demanding a job, Alcorn\nwas the one who was summoned. “I was told, ‘We’ve got a hippie kid in the lobby. He\nsays he’s not going to leave until we hire him. Should we call the cops or let him in?’ I\nsaid bring him on in!”\n\nJobs thus became one of the first fifty employees at Atari, working as a technician\nfor $5 an hour. “In retrospect, it was weird to hire a dropout from Reed,” Alcorn\nrecalled. “But I saw something in him. He was very intelligent, enthusiastic, excited\nabout tech.” Alcorn assigned him to work with a straitlaced engineer named Don Lang.\nThe next day Lang complained, “This guy’s a goddamn hippie with b.o. Why did you do\nthis to me? And he’s impossible to deal with.” Jobs clung to the belief that his fruit-\nheavy vegetarian diet would prevent not just mucus but also body odor, even if he didn’t\nuse deodorant or shower regularly. It was a flawed theory.\nLang and others wanted to let Jobs go, but Bushnell worked out a solution. “The\nsmell and behavior wasn’t an issue with me,” he said. “Steve was prickly, but I kind of\nliked him. So I asked him to go on the night shift. It was a way to save him.” Jobs would\ncome in after Lang and others had left and work through most of the night. Even thus\nisolated, he became known for his brashness. On those occasions when he happened to\ninteract with others, he was prone to informing them that they were “dumb shits.” In\nretrospect, he stands by that judgment. “The only reason I shone was that everyone else\nwas so bad,” Jobs recalled.\nDespite his arrogance (or perhaps because of it) he was able to charm Atari’s boss.\n“He was more philosophical than the other people I worked with,” Bushnell recalled.\n“We used to discuss free will versus determinism. I tended to believe that things were\nmuch more determined, that we were programmed. If we had perfect information, we\ncould predict people’s actions. Steve felt the opposite.” That outlook accorded with his\nfaith in the power of the will to bend reality.\nJobs helped improve some of the games by pushing the chips to produce fun designs,\nand Bushnell’s inspiring willingness to play by his own rules rubbed off on him. In\naddition, he intuitively appreciated the simplicity of Atari’s games. They came with no\nmanual and needed to be uncomplicated enough that a stoned freshman could figure them\nout. The only instructions for Atari’s Star Trek game were “1. Insert quarter. 2. Avoid\nKlingons.”\nNot all of his coworkers  shunned  Jobs.  He  became  friends  with  Ron  Wayne,  a\ndraftsman  at  Atari,  who  had  earlier  started  a  company  that  built  slot  machines.  It\nsubsequently failed, but Jobs became fascinated with the idea that it was possible to\nstart your own company. “Ron was an amazing guy,” said Jobs. “He started companies.\nI had never met anybody like that.” He proposed to Wayne that they go into business\ntogether; Jobs said he could borrow $50,000, and they could design and market a slot\nmachine. But Wayne had already been burned in business, so he declined. “I said that\nwas the quickest way to lose $50,000,” Wayne recalled, “but I admired the fact that he\nhad a burning drive to start his own business.”\nOne weekend Jobs was visiting Wayne at his apartment, engaging as they often did in\nphilosophical discussions, when Wayne said that there was something he needed to tell\nhim. “Yeah, I think I know what it is,” Jobs replied. “I think you like men.” Wayne said\nyes. “It was my first encounter with someone who I knew was gay,” Jobs recalled. “He\n\nplanted the right perspective of it for me.” Jobs grilled him: “When you see a beautiful\nwoman, what do you feel?” Wayne replied, “It’s like when you look at a beautiful horse.\nYou can appreciate it, but you don’t want to sleep with it. You appreciate beauty for\nwhat it is.” Wayne said that it is a testament to Jobs that he felt like revealing this to\nhim. “Nobody at Atari knew, and I could count on my toes and fingers the number of\npeople I told in my whole life. But I guess it just felt right to tell him, that he would\nunderstand, and it didn’t have any effect on our relationship.”\nIndia\nOne  reason  Jobs  was  eager  to  make  some  money  in  early  1974  was  that  Robert\nFriedland, who had gone to India the summer before, was urging him to take his own\nspiritual  journey  there.  Friedland  had  studied  in  India  with  Neem  Karoli  Baba\n(Maharaj-ji), who had been the guru to much of the sixties hippie movement. Jobs\ndecided he should do the same, and he recruited Daniel Kottke to go with him. Jobs was\nnot motivated by mere adventure. “For me it was a serious search,” he said. “I’d been\nturned on to the idea of enlightenment and trying to figure out who I was and how I fit\ninto things.” Kottke adds that Jobs’s quest seemed driven partly by not knowing his birth\nparents. “There was a hole in him, and he was trying to fill it.”\nWhen Jobs told the folks at Atari that he was quitting to go search for a guru in India,\nthe jovial Alcorn was amused. “He comes in and stares at me and declares, ‘I’m going\nto find my guru,’ and I say, ‘No shit, that’s super. Write me!’ And he says he wants me to\nhelp pay, and I tell him, ‘Bullshit!’” Then Alcorn had an idea. Atari was making kits and\nshipping them to Munich, where they were built into finished machines and distributed\nby a wholesaler in Turin. But there was a problem: Because the games were designed\nfor the American rate of sixty frames per second, there were frustrating interference\nproblems in Europe, where the rate was fifty frames per second. Alcorn sketched out a\nfix with Jobs and then offered to pay for him to go to Europe to implement it. “It’s got to\nbe cheaper to get to India from there,” he said. Jobs agreed. So Alcorn sent him on his\nway with the exhortation, “Say hi to your guru for me.”\nJobs spent a few days in Munich, where he solved the interference problem, but in\nthe  process  he  flummoxed  the  dark-suited  German  managers.  They  complained  to\nAlcorn that he dressed and smelled like a bum and behaved rudely. “I said, ‘Did he\nsolve the problem?’ And they said, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘If you got any more problems, you\njust call me, I got more guys just like him!’ They said, ‘No, no we’ll take care of it next\ntime.’” For his part, Jobs was upset that the Germans kept trying to feed him meat and\npotatoes. “They don’t even have a word for vegetarian,” he complained (incorrectly) in\na phone call to Alcorn.\n\nHe had a better time when he took the train to see the distributor in Turin, where the\nItalian pastas and his host’s camaraderie were more simpatico. “I had a wonderful\ncouple of weeks in Turin, which is this charged-up industrial town,” he recalled. “The\ndistributor took me every night to dinner at this place where there were only eight tables\nand no menu. You’d just tell them what you wanted, and they made it. One of the tables\nwas on reserve for the chairman of Fiat. It was really super.” He next went to Lugano,\nSwitzerland, where he stayed with Friedland’s uncle, and from there took a flight to\nIndia.\nWhen he got off the plane in New Delhi, he felt waves of heat rising from the tarmac,\neven though it was only April. He had been given the name of a hotel, but it was full, so\nhe  went  to  one  his  taxi  driver  insisted  was  good.  “I’m  sure  he  was  getting  some\nbaksheesh, because he took me to this complete dive.” Jobs asked the owner whether\nthe water was filtered and foolishly believed the answer. “I got dysentery pretty fast. I\nwas sick, really sick, a really high fever. I dropped from 160 pounds to 120 in about a\nweek.”\nOnce he got healthy enough to move, he decided that he needed to get out of Delhi.\nSo he headed to the town of Haridwar, in northern India near the source of the Ganges,\nwhich was having a festival known as the Kumbh Mela. More than ten million people\npoured into a town that usually contained fewer than 100,000 residents. “There were\nholy men all around. Tents with this teacher and that teacher. There were people riding\nelephants, you name it. I was there for a few days, but I decided that I needed to get out\nof there too.”\nHe went by train and bus to a village near Nainital in the foothills of the Himalayas.\nThat was where Neem Karoli Baba lived, or had lived. By the time Jobs got there, he\nwas no longer alive, at least in the same incarnation. Jobs rented a room with a mattress\non the floor from a family who helped him recuperate by feeding him vegetarian meals.\n“There was a copy there of Autobiography of a Yogi in English that a previous traveler\nhad left, and I read it several times because there was not a lot to do, and I walked\naround from village to village and recovered from my dysentery.” Among those who\nwere  part  of  the  community  there  was  Larry  Brilliant,  an  epidemiologist  who  was\nworking to eradicate smallpox and who later ran Google’s philanthropic arm and the\nSkoll Foundation. He became Jobs’s lifelong friend.\nAt one point Jobs was told of a young Hindu holy man who was holding a gathering\nof his followers at the Himalayan estate of a wealthy businessman. “It was a chance to\nmeet a spiritual being and hang out with his followers, but it was also a chance to have\na good meal. I could smell the food as we got near, and I was very hungry.” As Jobs\nwas eating, the holy man—who was not much older than Jobs—picked him out of the\ncrowd, pointed at him, and began laughing maniacally. “He came running over and\ngrabbed me and made a tooting sound and said, ‘You are just like a baby,’” recalled\nJobs. “I was not relishing this attention.” Taking Jobs by the hand, he led him out of the\nworshipful crowd and walked him up to a hill, where there was a well and a small\n\npond. “We sit down and he pulls out this straight razor. I’m thinking he’s a nutcase and\nbegin to worry. Then he pulls out a bar of soap—I had long hair at the time—and he\nlathered up my hair and shaved my head. He told me that he was saving my health.”\nDaniel Kottke arrived in India at the beginning of the summer, and Jobs went back to\nNew Delhi to meet him. They wandered, mainly by bus, rather aimlessly. By this point\nJobs was no longer trying to find a guru who could impart wisdom, but instead was\nseeking enlightenment through ascetic experience, deprivation, and simplicity. He was\nnot able to achieve inner calm. Kottke remembers him getting into a furious shouting\nmatch  with  a  Hindu  woman  in  a  village  marketplace  who,  Jobs  alleged,  had  been\nwatering down the milk she was selling them.\nYet Jobs could also be generous. When they got to the town of Manali, Kottke’s\nsleeping  bag  was  stolen  with  his  traveler’s  checks  in  it.  “Steve  covered  my  food\nexpenses and bus ticket back to Delhi,” Kottke recalled. He also gave Kottke the rest of\nhis own money, $100, to tide him over.\nDuring his seven months in India, he had written to his parents only sporadically,\ngetting mail at the American Express office in New Delhi when he passed through, and\nso they were somewhat surprised when they got a call from the Oakland airport asking\nthem to pick him up. They immediately drove up from Los Altos. “My head had been\nshaved, I was wearing Indian cotton robes, and my skin had turned a deep, chocolate\nbrown-red from the sun,” he recalled. “So I’m sitting there and my parents walked past\nme about five times and finally my mother came up and said ‘Steve?’ and I said ‘Hi!’”\nThey took him back home, where he continued trying to find himself. It was a pursuit\nwith many paths toward enlightenment. In the mornings and evenings he would meditate\nand study Zen, and in between he would drop in to audit physics or engineering courses\nat Stanford.\nThe Search\nJobs’s  interest  in  Eastern  spirituality,  Hinduism,  Zen  Buddhism,  and  the  search  for\nenlightenment was not merely the passing phase of a nineteen-year-old. Throughout his\nlife he would seek to follow many of the basic precepts of Eastern religions, such as the\nemphasis on experiential prajñā wisdom or cognitive understanding that is intuitively\nexperienced through concentration of the mind. Years later, sitting in his Palo Alto\ngarden, he reflected on the lasting influence of his trip to India:\nComing back to America was, for me, much more of a cultural shock than going to India.\nThe people in the Indian countryside don’t use their intellect like we do, they use their\nintuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world.\n\nIntuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion. That’s\nhad a big impact on my work.\nWestern rational thought is not an innate human characteristic; it is learned and is the\ngreat achievement of Western civilization. In the villages of India, they never learned it.\nThey learned something else, which is in some ways just as valuable but in other ways\nis not. That’s the power of intuition and experiential wisdom.\nComing  back  after  seven  months  in  Indian  villages,  I  saw  the  craziness  of  the\nWestern world as well as its capacity for rational thought. If you just sit and observe,\nyou will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but\nover time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things—\nthat’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and\nbe in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse\nin the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you\nhave to practice it.\nZen has been a deep influence in my life ever since. At one point I was thinking\nabout going to Japan and trying to get into the Eihei-ji monastery, but my spiritual\nadvisor urged me to stay here. He said there is nothing over there that isn’t here, and he\nwas correct. I learned the truth of the Zen saying that if you are willing to travel around\nthe world to meet a teacher, one will appear next door.\nJobs did in fact find a teacher right in his own neighborhood. Shunryu Suzuki, who\nwrote Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind and ran the San Francisco Zen Center, used to come\nto Los Altos every Wednesday evening to lecture and meditate with a small group of\nfollowers. After a while he asked his assistant, Kobun Chino Otogawa, to open a full-\ntime center there. Jobs became a faithful follower, along with his occasional girlfriend,\nChrisann Brennan, and Daniel Kottke and Elizabeth Holmes. He also began to go by\nhimself on retreats to the Tassajara Zen Center, a monastery near Carmel where Kobun\nalso taught.\nKottke found Kobun amusing. “His English was atrocious,” he recalled. “He would\nspeak in a kind of haiku, with poetic, suggestive phrases. We would sit and listen to\nhim, and half the time we had no idea what he was going on about. I took the whole\nthing as a kind of lighthearted interlude.” Holmes was more into the scene. “We would\ngo to Kobun’s meditations, sit on zafu cushions, and he would sit on a dais,” she said.\n“We learned how to tune out distractions. It was a magical thing. One evening we were\nmeditating with Kobun when it was raining, and he taught us how to use ambient sounds\nto bring us back to focus on our meditation.”\nAs for Jobs, his devotion was intense. “He became really serious and self-important\nand just generally unbearable,” according to Kottke. He began meeting with Kobun\nalmost daily, and every few months they went on retreats together to meditate. “I ended\nup spending as much time as I could with him,” Jobs recalled. “He had a wife who was\n\na nurse at Stanford and two kids. She worked the night shift, so I would go over and\nhang out with him in the evenings. She would get home about midnight and shoo me\naway.” They sometimes discussed whether Jobs should devote himself fully to spiritual\npursuits, but Kobun counseled otherwise. He assured Jobs that he could keep in touch\nwith his spiritual side while working in a business. The relationship turned out to be\nlasting  and  deep;  seventeen  years  later  Kobun  would  perform  Jobs’s  wedding\nceremony.\nJobs’s compulsive search for self-awareness also led him to undergo primal scream\ntherapy,  which  had  recently  been  developed  and  popularized  by  a  Los  Angeles\npsychotherapist  named  Arthur  Janov.  It  was  based  on  the  Freudian  theory  that\npsychological problems are caused by the repressed pains of childhood; Janov argued\nthat they could be resolved by re-suffering these primal moments while fully expressing\nthe  pain—sometimes  in  screams.  To  Jobs,  this  seemed  preferable  to  talk  therapy\nbecause  it  involved  intuitive  feeling  and  emotional  action  rather  than  just  rational\nanalyzing. “This was not something to think about,” he later said. “This was something\nto do: to close your eyes, hold your breath, jump in, and come out the other end more\ninsightful.”\nA group of Janov’s adherents ran a program called the Oregon Feeling Center in an\nold hotel in Eugene that was managed by Jobs’s Reed College guru Robert Friedland,\nwhose All One Farm commune was nearby. In late 1974, Jobs signed up for a twelve-\nweek course of therapy there costing $1,000. “Steve and I were both into personal\ngrowth, so I wanted to go with him,” Kottke recounted, “but I couldn’t afford it.”\nJobs confided to close friends that he was driven by the pain he was feeling about\nbeing put up for adoption and not knowing about his birth parents. “Steve had a very\nprofound  desire  to  know  his  physical  parents  so  he  could  better  know  himself,”\nFriedland later said. He had learned from Paul and Clara Jobs that his birth parents had\nboth been graduate students at a university and that his father might be Syrian. He had\neven thought about hiring a private investigator, but he decided not to do so for the time\nbeing. “I didn’t want to hurt my parents,” he recalled, referring to Paul and Clara.\n“He was struggling with the fact that he had been adopted,” according to Elizabeth\nHolmes. “He felt that it was an issue that he needed to get hold of emotionally.” Jobs\nadmitted as much to her. “This is something that is bothering me, and I need to focus on\nit,” he said. He was even more open with Greg Calhoun. “He was doing a lot of soul-\nsearching about being adopted, and he talked about it with me a lot,” Calhoun recalled.\n“The primal scream and the mucusless diets, he was trying to cleanse himself and get\ndeeper into his frustration about his birth. He told me he was deeply angry about the fact\nthat he had been given up.”\nJohn  Lennon  had  undergone  the  same  primal  scream  therapy  in  1970,  and  in\nDecember of that year he released the song “Mother” with the Plastic Ono Band. It dealt\nwith Lennon’s own feelings about a father who had abandoned him and a mother who\n\nhad been killed when he was a teenager. The refrain includes the haunting chant “Mama\ndon’t go, Daddy come home.” Jobs used to play the song often.\nJobs later said that Janov’s teachings did not prove very useful. “He offered a ready-\nmade, buttoned-down answer which turned out to be far too oversimplistic. It became\nobvious that it was not going to yield any great insight.” But Holmes contended that it\nmade him more confident: “After he did it, he was in a different place. He had a very\nabrasive personality, but there was a peace about him for a while. His confidence\nimproved and his feelings of inadequacy were reduced.”\nJobs came to believe that he could impart that feeling of confidence to others and\nthus push them to do things they hadn’t thought possible. Holmes had broken up with\nKottke and joined a religious cult in San Francisco that expected her to sever ties with\nall past friends. But Jobs rejected that injunction. He arrived at the cult house in his\nFord Ranchero one day and announced that he was driving up to Friedland’s apple farm\nand she was to come. Even more brazenly, he said she would have to drive part of the\nway, even though she didn’t know how to use the stick shift. “Once we got on the open\nroad, he made me get behind the wheel, and he shifted the car until we got up to 55\nmiles per hour,” she recalled. “Then he puts on a tape of Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks,\nlays his head in my lap, and goes to sleep. He had the attitude that he could do anything,\nand therefore so can you. He put his life in my hands. So that made me do something I\ndidn’t think I could do.”\nIt was the brighter side of what would become known as his reality distortion field.\n“If you trust him, you can do things,” Holmes said. “If he’s decided that something\nshould happen, then he’s just going to make it happen.”\nBreakout\nOne day in early 1975 Al Alcorn was sitting in his office at Atari when Ron Wayne\nburst in. “Hey, Stevie is back!” he shouted.\n“Wow, bring him on in,” Alcorn replied.\nJobs shuffled in barefoot, wearing a saffron robe and carrying a copy of Be Here\nNow, which he handed to Alcorn and insisted he read. “Can I have my job back?” he\nasked.\n“He looked like a Hare Krishna guy, but it was great to see him,” Alcorn recalled.\n“So I said, sure!”\nOnce again, for the sake of harmony, Jobs worked mostly at night. Wozniak, who was\nliving in an apartment nearby and working at HP, would come by after dinner to hang\nout and play the video games. He had become addicted to Pong at a Sunnyvale bowling\nalley, and he was able to build a version that he hooked up to his home TV set.\n\nOne day in the late summer of 1975, Nolan Bushnell, defying the prevailing wisdom\nthat paddle games were over, decided to develop a single-player version of Pong;\ninstead of competing against an opponent, the player would volley the ball into a wall\nthat lost a brick whenever it was hit. He called Jobs into his office, sketched it out on\nhis little blackboard, and asked him to design it. There would be a bonus, Bushnell told\nhim, for every chip fewer than fifty that he used. Bushnell knew that Jobs was not a\ngreat engineer, but he assumed, correctly, that he would recruit Wozniak, who was\nalways hanging around. “I looked at it as a two-for-one thing,” Bushnell recalled. “Woz\nwas a better engineer.”\nWozniak was thrilled when Jobs asked him to help and proposed splitting the fee.\n“This was the most wonderful offer in my life, to actually design a game that people\nwould use,” he recalled. Jobs said it had to be done in four days and with the fewest\nchips possible. What he hid from Wozniak was that the deadline was one that Jobs had\nimposed, because he needed to get to the All One Farm to help prepare for the apple\nharvest. He also didn’t mention that there was a bonus tied to keeping down the number\nof chips.\n“A game like this might take most engineers a few months,” Wozniak recalled. “I\nthought that there was no way I could do it, but Steve made me sure that I could.” So he\nstayed up four nights in a row and did it. During the day at HP, Wozniak would sketch\nout his design on paper. Then, after a fast-food meal, he would go right to Atari and stay\nall  night.  As  Wozniak  churned  out  the  design,  Jobs  sat  on  a  bench  to  his  left\nimplementing  it  by  wire-wrapping  the  chips  onto  a  breadboard.  “While  Steve  was\nbreadboarding, I spent time playing my favorite game ever, which was the auto racing\ngame Gran Trak 10,” Wozniak said.\nAstonishingly, they were able to get the job done in four days, and Wozniak used\nonly  forty-five  chips.  Recollections  differ,  but  by  most  accounts  Jobs  simply  gave\nWozniak half of the base fee and not the bonus Bushnell paid for saving five chips. It\nwould be another ten years before Wozniak discovered (by being shown the tale in a\nbook on the history of Atari titled Zap) that Jobs had been paid this bonus. “I think that\nSteve needed the money, and he just didn’t tell me the truth,” Wozniak later said. When\nhe talks about it now, there are long pauses, and he admits that it causes him pain. “I\nwish he had just been honest. If he had told me he needed the money, he should have\nknown I would have just given it to him. He was a friend. You help your friends.” To\nWozniak,  it  showed  a  fundamental  difference  in  their  characters.  “Ethics  always\nmattered to me, and I still don’t understand why he would’ve gotten paid one thing and\ntold me he’d gotten paid another,” he said. “But, you know, people are different.”\nWhen Jobs learned this story was published, he called Wozniak to deny it. “He told\nme that he didn’t remember doing it, and that if he did something like that he would\nremember  it,  so  he  probably  didn’t  do  it,”  Wozniak  recalled.  When  I  asked  Jobs\ndirectly, he became unusually quiet and hesitant. “I don’t know where that allegation\ncomes from,” he said. “I gave him half the money I ever got. That’s how I’ve always\n\nbeen with Woz. I mean, Woz stopped working in 1978. He never did one ounce of work\nafter 1978. And yet he got exactly the same shares of Apple stock that I did.”\nIs it possible that memories are muddled and that Jobs did not, in fact, shortchange\nWozniak? “There’s a chance that my memory is all wrong and messed up,” Wozniak told\nme, but after a pause he reconsidered. “But no. I remember the details of this one, the\n$350  check.”  He  confirmed  his  memory  with  Nolan  Bushnell  and  Al  Alcorn.  “I\nremember talking about the bonus money to Woz, and he was upset,” Bushnell said. “I\nsaid yes, there was a bonus for each chip they saved, and he just shook his head and\nthen clucked his tongue.”\nWhatever the truth, Wozniak later insisted that it was not worth rehashing. Jobs is a\ncomplex person, he said, and being manipulative is just the darker facet of the traits that\nmake him successful. Wozniak would never have been that way, but as he points out, he\nalso could never have built Apple. “I would rather let it pass,” he said when I pressed\nthe point. “It’s not something I want to judge Steve by.”\nThe  Atari  experience  helped  shape  Jobs’s  approach  to  business  and  design.  He\nappreciated the user-friendliness of Atari’s insert-quarter avoid-Klingons games. “That\nsimplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person,” said Ron\nWayne.  Jobs  also  absorbed  some  of  Bushnell’s  take-no-prisoners  attitude.  “Nolan\nwouldn’t  take  no  for  an  answer,”  according  to  Alcorn,  “and  this  was  Steve’s  first\nimpression of how things got done. Nolan was never abusive, like Steve sometimes is.\nBut he had the same driven attitude. It made me cringe, but dammit, it got things done. In\nthat way Nolan was a mentor for Jobs.”\nBushnell agreed. “There is something indefinable in an entrepreneur, and I saw that\nin Steve,” he said. “He was interested not just in engineering, but also the business\naspects. I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told\nhim, ‘Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.’”\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTHE APPLE I\nTurn On, Boot Up, Jack In ...\nDaniel Kottke and Jobs with the Apple I at the Atlantic City computer fair, 1976\nMachines of Loving Grace\nIn San Francisco and the Santa Clara Valley during the late 1960s, various cultural\ncurrents  flowed  together.  There  was  the  technology  revolution  that  began  with  the\ngrowth of military contractors and soon included electronics firms, microchip makers,\nvideo game designers, and computer companies. There was a hacker subculture—filled\n\nwith wireheads, phreakers, cyberpunks, hobbyists, and just plain geeks—that included\nengineers who didn’t conform to the HP mold and their kids who weren’t attuned to the\nwavelengths of the subdivisions. There were quasi-academic groups doing studies on\nthe effects of LSD; participants included Doug Engelbart of the Augmentation Research\nCenter in Palo Alto, who later helped develop the computer mouse and graphical user\ninterfaces,  and  Ken  Kesey,  who  celebrated  the  drug  with  music-and-light  shows\nfeaturing a house band that became the Grateful Dead. There was the hippie movement,\nborn out of the Bay Area’s beat generation, and the rebellious political activists, born\nout of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. Overlaid on it all were various self-\nfulfillment movements pursuing paths to personal enlightenment: Zen and Hinduism,\nmeditation and yoga, primal scream and sensory deprivation, Esalen and est.\nThis fusion of flower power and processor power, enlightenment and technology,\nwas embodied by Steve Jobs as he meditated in the mornings, audited physics classes at\nStanford, worked nights at Atari, and dreamed of starting his own business. “There was\njust something going on here,” he said, looking back at the time and place. “The best\nmusic came from here—the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin\n—and so did the integrated circuit, and things like the Whole Earth Catalog.”\nInitially  the  technologists  and  the  hippies  did  not  interface  well.  Many  in  the\ncounterculture saw computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of the Pentagon\nand the power structure. In The  Myth  of  the  Machine, the historian Lewis Mumford\nwarned that computers were sucking away our freedom and destroying “life-enhancing\nvalues.”  An  injunction  on  punch  cards  of  the  period—“Do  not  fold,  spindle  or\nmutilate”—became an ironic phrase of the antiwar Left.\nBut  by  the  early  1970s  a  shift  was  under  way.  “Computing  went  from  being\ndismissed as a tool of bureaucratic control to being embraced as a symbol of individual\nexpression and liberation,” John Markoff wrote in his study of the counterculture’s\nconvergence with the computer industry, What  the  Dormouse  Said. It was an ethos\nlyrically expressed in Richard Brautigan’s 1967 poem, “All Watched Over by Machines\nof Loving Grace,” and the cyberdelic fusion was certified when Timothy Leary declared\nthat personal computers had become the new LSD and years later revised his famous\nmantra to proclaim, “Turn on, boot up, jack in.” The musician Bono, who later became a\nfriend of Jobs, often discussed with him why those immersed in the rock-drugs-rebel\ncounterculture  of  the  Bay  Area  ended  up  helping  to  create  the  personal  computer\nindustry. “The people who invented the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-\nwearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently,” he said.\n“The  hierarchical  systems  of  the  East  Coast,  England,  Germany,  and  Japan  do  not\nencourage this different thinking. The sixties produced an anarchic mind-set that is great\nfor imagining a world not yet in existence.”\nOne person who encouraged the denizens of the counterculture to make common\ncause with the hackers was Stewart Brand. A puckish visionary who generated fun and\nideas over many decades, Brand was a participant in one of the early sixties LSD\n\nstudies in Palo Alto. He joined with his fellow subject Ken Kesey to produce the acid-\ncelebrating Trips Festival, appeared in the opening scene of Tom Wolfe’s The Electric\nKool-Aid  Acid  Test, and worked with Doug Engelbart to create a seminal sound-and-\nlight presentation of new technologies called the Mother of All Demos. “Most of our\ngeneration scorned computers as the embodiment of centralized control,” Brand later\nnoted. “But a tiny contingent—later called hackers—embraced computers and set about\ntransforming them into tools of liberation. That turned out to be the true royal road to the\nfuture.”\nBrand ran the Whole Earth Truck Store, which began as a roving truck that sold\nuseful tools and educational materials, and in 1968 he decided to extend its reach with\nthe Whole Earth Catalog. On its first cover was the famous picture of Earth taken from\nspace;  its  subtitle  was  “Access  to  Tools.”  The  underlying  philosophy  was  that\ntechnology could be our friend. Brand wrote on the first page of the first edition, “A\nrealm of intimate, personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct\nhis own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his\nadventure  with  whoever  is  interested.  Tools  that  aid  this  process  are  sought  and\npromoted by the Whole Earth Catalog.” Buckminster Fuller followed with a poem that\nbegan: “I see God in the instruments and mechanisms that work reliably.”\nJobs became a Whole Earth fan. He was particularly taken by the final issue, which\ncame out in 1971, when he was still in high school, and he brought it with him to\ncollege and then to the All One Farm. “On the back cover of their final issue” Jobs\nrecalled, “was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find\nyourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: ‘Stay\nHungry.  Stay  Foolish.’”  Brand  sees  Jobs  as  one  of  the  purest  embodiments  of  the\ncultural mix that the catalog sought to celebrate. “Steve is right at the nexus of the\ncounterculture and technology,” he said. “He got the notion of tools for human use.”\nBrand’s catalog was published with the help of the Portola Institute, a foundation\ndedicated  to  the  fledgling  field  of  computer  education.  The  foundation  also  helped\nlaunch  the  People’s  Computer  Company,  which  was  not  a  company  at  all  but  a\nnewsletter and organization with the motto “Computer power to the people.” There\nwere occasional Wednesday-night potluck dinners, and two of the regulars, Gordon\nFrench  and  Fred  Moore,  decided  to  create  a  more  formal  club  where  news  about\npersonal electronics could be shared.\nThey  were  energized  by  the  arrival  of  the  January  1975  issue  of Popular\nElectronics, which had on its cover the first personal computer kit, the Altair. The\nAltair wasn’t much—just a $495 pile of parts that had to be soldered to a board that\nwould then do little—but for hobbyists and hackers it heralded the dawn of a new era.\nBill  Gates  and  Paul  Allen  read  the  magazine  and  started  working  on  a  version  of\nBASIC, an easy-to-use programming language, for the Altair. It also caught the attention\nof  Jobs  and  Wozniak.  And  when  an  Altair  kit  arrived  at  the  People’s  Computer\n\nCompany, it became the centerpiece for the first meeting of the club that French and\nMoore had decided to launch.\nThe Homebrew Computer Club\nThe group became known as the Homebrew Computer Club, and it encapsulated the\nWhole Earth fusion between the counterculture and technology. It would become to the\npersonal computer era something akin to what the Turk’s Head coffeehouse was to the\nage of Dr. Johnson, a place where ideas were exchanged and disseminated. Moore\nwrote the flyer for the first meeting, held on March 5, 1975, in French’s Menlo Park\ngarage: “Are you building your own computer? Terminal, TV, typewriter?” it asked. “If\nso, you might like to come to a gathering of people with like-minded interests.”\nAllen Baum spotted the flyer on the HP bulletin board and called Wozniak, who\nagreed to go with him. “That night turned out to be one of the most important nights of\nmy  life,”  Wozniak  recalled.  About  thirty  other  people  showed  up,  spilling  out  of\nFrench’s open garage door, and they took turns describing their interests. Wozniak, who\nlater admitted to being extremely nervous, said he liked “video games, pay movies for\nhotels, scientific calculator design, and TV terminal design,” according to the minutes\nprepared by Moore. There was a demonstration of the new Altair, but more important to\nWozniak was seeing the specification sheet for a microprocessor.\nAs he thought about the microprocessor—a chip that had an entire central processing\nunit on it—he had an insight. He had been designing a terminal, with a keyboard and\nmonitor, that would connect to a distant minicomputer. Using a microprocessor, he could\nput some of the capacity of the minicomputer inside the terminal itself, so it could\nbecome a small stand-alone computer on a desktop. It was an enduring idea: keyboard,\nscreen, and computer all in one integrated personal package. “This whole vision of a\npersonal computer just popped into my head,” he said. “That night, I started to sketch\nout on paper what would later become known as the Apple I.”\nAt first he planned to use the same microprocessor that was in the Altair, an Intel\n8080. But each of those “cost almost more than my monthly rent,” so he looked for an\nalternative. He found one in the Motorola 6800, which a friend at HP was able to get\nfor  $40  apiece.  Then  he  discovered  a  chip  made  by  MOS  Technologies  that  was\nelectronically the same but cost only $20. It would make his machine affordable, but it\nwould carry a long-term cost. Intel’s chips ended up becoming the industry standard,\nwhich would haunt Apple when its computers were incompatible with it.\nAfter work each day, Wozniak would go home for a TV dinner and then return to HP\nto moonlight on his computer. He spread out the parts in his cubicle, figured out their\nplacement, and soldered them onto his motherboard. Then he began writing the software\nthat would get the microprocessor to display images on the screen. Because he could\n\nnot afford to pay for computer time, he wrote the code by hand. After a couple of months\nhe was ready to test it. “I typed a few keys on the keyboard and I was shocked! The\nletters were displayed on the screen.” It was Sunday, June 29, 1975, a milestone for the\npersonal computer. “It was the first time in history,” Wozniak later said, “anyone had\ntyped a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on their own computer’s screen\nright in front of them.”\nJobs was impressed. He peppered Wozniak with questions: Could the computer ever\nbe networked? Was it possible to add a disk for memory storage? He also began to help\nWoz get components. Particularly important were the dynamic random-access memory\nchips. Jobs made a few calls and was able to score some from Intel for free. “Steve is\njust  that  sort  of  person,”  said  Wozniak.  “I  mean,  he  knew  how  to  talk  to  a  sales\nrepresentative. I could never have done that. I’m too shy.”\nJobs began to accompany Wozniak to Homebrew meetings, carrying the TV monitor\nand  helping  to  set  things  up.  The  meetings  now  attracted  more  than  one  hundred\nenthusiasts and had been moved to the auditorium of the Stanford Linear Accelerator\nCenter. Presiding with a pointer and a free-form manner was Lee Felsenstein, another\nembodiment of the merger between the world of computing and the counterculture. He\nwas an engineering school dropout, a participant in the Free Speech Movement, and an\nantiwar activist. He had written for the alternative newspaper Berkeley Barb and then\ngone back to being a computer engineer.\nWoz was usually too shy to talk in the meetings, but people would gather around his\nmachine afterward, and he would proudly show off his progress. Moore had tried to\ninstill in the Homebrew an ethos of swapping and sharing rather than commerce. “The\ntheme of the club,” Woz said, “was ‘Give to help others.’” It was an expression of the\nhacker ethic that information should be free and all authority mistrusted. “I designed the\nApple I because I wanted to give it away for free to other people,” said Wozniak.\nThis was not an outlook that Bill Gates embraced. After he and Paul Allen had\ncompleted their BASIC interpreter for the Altair, Gates was appalled that members of\nthe Homebrew were making copies of it and sharing it without paying him. So he wrote\nwhat would become a famous letter to the club: “As the majority of hobbyists must be\naware, most of you steal your software. Is this fair?... One thing you do is prevent good\nsoftware from being written. Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?... I\nwould appreciate letters from anyone who wants to pay up.”\nSteve Jobs, similarly, did not embrace the notion that Wozniak’s creations, be it a\nBlue Box or a computer, wanted to be free. So he convinced Wozniak to stop giving\naway copies of his schematics. Most people didn’t have time to build it themselves\nanyway, Jobs argued. “Why don’t we build and sell printed circuit boards to them?” It\nwas  an  example  of  their  symbiosis.  “Every  time  I’d  design  something  great,  Steve\nwould find a way to make money for us,” said Wozniak. Wozniak admitted that he would\nhave  never  thought  of  doing  that  on  his  own.  “It  never  crossed  my  mind  to  sell\ncomputers. It was Steve who said, ‘Let’s hold them in the air and sell a few.’”\n\nJobs worked out a plan to pay a guy he knew at Atari to draw the circuit boards and\nthen print up fifty or so. That would cost about $1,000, plus the fee to the designer. They\ncould sell them for $40 apiece and perhaps clear a profit of $700. Wozniak was dubious\nthat they could sell them all. “I didn’t see how we would make our money back,” he\nrecalled. He was already in trouble with his landlord for bouncing checks and now had\nto pay each month in cash.\nJobs knew how to appeal to Wozniak. He didn’t argue that they were sure to make\nmoney, but instead that they would have a fun adventure. “Even if we lose our money,\nwe’ll have a company,” said Jobs as they were driving in his Volkswagen bus. “For\nonce in our lives, we’ll have a company.” This was enticing to Wozniak, even more than\nany prospect of getting rich. He recalled, “I was excited to think about us like that. To\nbe two best friends starting a company. Wow. I knew right then that I’d do it. How could\nI not?”\nIn order to raise the money they needed, Wozniak sold his HP 65 calculator for\n$500, though the buyer ended up stiffing him for half of that. For his part, Jobs sold his\nVolkswagen bus for $1,500. But the person who bought it came to find him two weeks\nlater and said the engine had broken down, and Jobs agreed to pay for half of the\nrepairs.  Despite  these  little  setbacks,  they  now  had,  with  their  own  small  savings\nthrown in, about $1,300 in working capital, the design for a product, and a plan. They\nwould start their own computer company.\nApple Is Born\nNow that they had decided to start a business, they needed a name. Jobs had gone for\nanother visit to the All One Farm, where he had been pruning the Gravenstein apple\ntrees, and Wozniak picked him up at the airport. On the ride down to Los Altos, they\nbandied around options. They considered some typical tech words, such as Matrix, and\nsome  neologisms,  such  as  Executek,  and  some  straightforward  boring  names,  like\nPersonal Computers Inc. The deadline for deciding was the next day, when Jobs wanted\nto start filing the papers. Finally Jobs proposed Apple Computer. “I was on one of my\nfruitarian diets,” he explained. “I had just come back from the apple farm. It sounded\nfun, spirited, and not intimidating. Apple took the edge off the word ‘computer.’ Plus, it\nwould get us ahead of Atari in the phone book.” He told Wozniak that if a better name\ndid not hit them by the next afternoon, they would just stick with Apple. And they did.\nApple.  It  was  a  smart choice.  The  word  instantly  signaled  friendliness  and\nsimplicity. It managed to be both slightly off-beat and as normal as a slice of pie. There\nwas a whiff of counterculture, back-to-nature earthiness to it, yet nothing could be more\nAmerican.  And  the  two  words  together—Apple  Computer—provided  an  amusing\ndisjuncture. “It doesn’t quite make sense,” said Mike Markkula, who soon thereafter\n\nbecame the first chairman of the new company. “So it forces your brain to dwell on it.\nApple and computers, that doesn’t go together! So it helped us grow brand awareness.”\nWozniak was not yet ready to commit full-time. He was an HP company man at heart,\nor so he thought, and he wanted to keep his day job there. Jobs realized he needed an\nally to help corral Wozniak and adjudicate if there was a disagreement. So he enlisted\nhis friend Ron Wayne, the middle-aged engineer at Atari who had once started a slot\nmachine company.\nWayne knew that it would not be easy to make Wozniak quit HP, nor was it necessary\nright away. Instead the key was to convince him that his computer designs would be\nowned by the Apple partnership. “Woz had a parental attitude toward the circuits he\ndeveloped, and he wanted to be able to use them in other applications or let HP use\nthem,” Wayne said. “Jobs and I realized that these circuits would be the core of Apple.\nWe spent two hours in a roundtable discussion at my apartment, and I was able to get\nWoz to accept this.” His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only\nif he teamed with a great marketer, and this required him to commit his designs to the\npartnership. Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a 10% stake in\nthe new partnership, turning him into a tie-breaker if Jobs and Wozniak disagreed over\nan issue.\n“They were very different, but they made a powerful team,” said Wayne. Jobs at\ntimes seemed to be driven by demons, while Woz seemed a naïf who was toyed with by\nangels.  Jobs  had  a  bravado  that  helped  him  get  things  done,  occasionally  by\nmanipulating people. He could be charismatic, even mesmerizing, but also cold and\nbrutal. Wozniak, in contrast, was shy and socially awkward, which made him seem\nchildishly sweet. “Woz is very bright in some areas, but he’s almost like a savant, since\nhe was so stunted when it came to dealing with people he didn’t know,” said Jobs. “We\nwere a good pair.” It helped that Jobs was awed by Wozniak’s engineering wizardry,\nand Wozniak was awed by Jobs’s business drive. “I never wanted to deal with people\nand step on toes, but Steve could call up people he didn’t know and make them do\nthings,” Wozniak recalled. “He could be rough on people he didn’t think were smart, but\nhe never treated me rudely, even in later years when maybe I couldn’t answer a question\nas well as he wanted.”\nEven after Wozniak became convinced that his new computer design should become\nthe property of the Apple partnership, he felt that he had to offer it first to HP, since he\nwas working there. “I believed it was my duty to tell HP about what I had designed\nwhile  working  for  them.  That  was  the  right  thing  and  the  ethical  thing.”  So  he\ndemonstrated it to his managers in the spring of 1976. The senior executive at the\nmeeting was impressed, and seemed torn, but he finally said it was not something that\nHP could develop. It was a hobbyist product, at least for now, and didn’t fit into the\ncompany’s high-quality market segments. “I was disappointed,” Wozniak recalled, “but\nnow I was free to enter into the Apple partnership.”\n\nOn April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak went to Wayne’s apartment in Mountain View to\ndraw up the partnership agreement. Wayne said he had some experience “writing in\nlegalese,” so he composed the three-page document himself. His “legalese” got the\nbetter of him. Paragraphs began with various flourishes: “Be it noted herewith ... Be it\nfurther  noted  herewith  ...  Now  the  refore  [sic],  in  consideration  of  the  respective\nassignments  of  interests  ...”  But  the  division  of  shares  and  profits  was  clear—\n45%-45%-10%—and it was stipulated that any expenditures of more than $100 would\nrequire agreement of at least two of the partners. Also, the responsibilities were spelled\nout. “Wozniak shall assume both general and major responsibility for the conduct of\nElectrical  Engineering;  Jobs  shall  assume  general  responsibility  for  Electrical\nEngineering  and  Marketing,  and  Wayne  shall  assume  major  responsibility  for\nMechanical Engineering and Documentation.” Jobs signed in lowercase script, Wozniak\nin careful cursive, and Wayne in an illegible squiggle.\nWayne then got cold feet. As Jobs started planning to borrow and spend more money,\nhe recalled the failure of his own company. He didn’t want to go through that again.\nJobs and Wozniak had no personal assets, but Wayne (who worried about a global\nfinancial  Armageddon)  kept  gold  coins  hidden  in  his  mattress.  Because  they  had\nstructured Apple as a simple partnership rather than a corporation, the partners would\nbe personally liable for the debts, and Wayne was afraid potential creditors would go\nafter him. So he returned to the Santa Clara County office just eleven days later with a\n“statement of withdrawal” and an amendment to the partnership agreement. “By virtue\nof a re-assessment of understandings by and between all parties,” it began, “Wayne\nshall hereinafter cease to function in the status of ‘Partner.’” It noted that in payment for\nhis 10% of the company, he received $800, and shortly afterward $1,500 more.\nHad he stayed on and kept his 10% stake, at the end of 2012 it would have been\nworth approximately $54 billion. Instead he was then living alone in a small home in\nPahrump, Nevada, where he played the penny slot machines and lived off his social\nsecurity check. He later claimed he had no regrets. “I made the best decision for me at\nthe time. Both of them were real whirlwinds, and I knew my stomach and it wasn’t\nready for such a ride.”\nJobs and Wozniak took the stage together for a presentation to the Homebrew Computer\nClub shortly after they signed Apple into existence. Wozniak held up one of their newly\nproduced  circuit  boards  and  described  the  microprocessor,  the  eight  kilobytes  of\nmemory, and the version of BASIC he had written. He also emphasized what he called\nthe main thing: “a human-typable keyboard instead of a stupid, cryptic front panel with a\nbunch of lights and switches.” Then it was Jobs’s turn. He pointed out that the Apple,\nunlike the Altair, had all the essential components built in. Then he challenged them\nwith a question: How much would people be willing to pay for such a wonderful\n\nmachine? He was trying to get them to see the amazing value of the Apple. It was a\nrhetorical flourish he would use at product presentations over the ensuing decades.\nThe audience was not very impressed. The Apple had a cut-rate microprocessor, not\nthe Intel 8080. But one important person stayed behind to hear more. His name was Paul\nTerrell, and in 1975 he had opened a computer store, which he dubbed the Byte Shop,\non Camino Real in Menlo Park. Now, a year later, he had three stores and visions of\nbuilding a national chain. Jobs was thrilled to give him a private demo. “Take a look at\nthis,” he said. “You’re going to like what you see.” Terrell was impressed enough to\nhand Jobs and Woz his card. “Keep in touch,” he said.\n“I’m keeping in touch,” Jobs announced the next day when he walked barefoot into\nthe Byte Shop. He made the sale. Terrell agreed to order fifty computers. But there was\na condition: He didn’t want just $50 printed circuit boards, for which customers would\nthen have to buy all the chips and do the assembly. That might appeal to a few hard-core\nhobbyists,  but  not  to  most  customers.  Instead  he  wanted  the  boards  to  be  fully\nassembled. For that he was willing to pay about $500 apiece, cash on delivery.\nJobs immediately called Wozniak at HP. “Are you sitting down?” he asked. Wozniak\nsaid he wasn’t. Jobs nevertheless proceeded to give him the news. “I was shocked, just\ncompletely shocked,” Wozniak recalled. “I will never forget that moment.”\nTo fill the order, they needed about $15,000 worth of parts. Allen Baum, the third\nprankster from Homestead High, and his father agreed to loan them $5,000. Jobs tried to\nborrow  more  from  a  bank  in  Los  Altos,  but  the  manager  looked  at  him  and,  not\nsurprisingly, declined. He went to Haltek Supply and offered an equity stake in Apple in\nreturn for the parts, but the owner decided they were “a couple of young, scruffy-\nlooking guys,” and declined. Alcorn at Atari would sell them chips only if they paid\ncash up front. Finally, Jobs was able to convince the manager of Cramer Electronics to\ncall Paul Terrell to confirm that he had really committed to a $25,000 order. Terrell\nwas at a conference when he heard over a loudspeaker that he had an emergency call\n(Jobs had been persistent). The Cramer manager told him that two scruffy kids had just\nwalked in waving an order from the Byte Shop. Was it real? Terrell confirmed that it\nwas, and the store agreed to front Jobs the parts on thirty-day credit.\nGarage Band\nThe Jobs house in Los Altos became the assembly point for the fifty Apple I boards that\nhad to be delivered to the Byte Shop within thirty days, when the payment for the parts\nwould come due. All available hands were enlisted: Jobs and Wozniak, plus Daniel\nKottke, his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes (who had broken away from the cult she’d\njoined), and Jobs’s pregnant sister, Patty. Her vacated bedroom as well as the kitchen\ntable and garage were commandeered as work space. Holmes, who had taken jewelry\n\nclasses, was given the task of soldering chips. “Most I did well, but I got flux on a few\nof them,” she recalled. This didn’t please Jobs. “We don’t have a chip to spare,” he\nrailed, correctly. He shifted her to bookkeeping and paperwork at the kitchen table, and\nhe did the soldering himself. When they completed a board, they would hand it off to\nWozniak. “I would plug each assembled board into the TV and keyboard to test it to see\nif it worked,” he said. “If it did, I put it in a box. If it didn’t, I’d figure what pin hadn’t\ngotten into the socket right.”\nPaul Jobs suspended his sideline of repairing old cars so that the Apple team could\nhave  the  whole  garage.  He  put  in  a  long  old  workbench,  hung  a  schematic  of  the\ncomputer on the new plasterboard wall he built, and set up rows of labeled drawers for\nthe components. He also built a burn box bathed in heat lamps so the computer boards\ncould  be  tested  by  running  overnight  at  high  temperatures.  When  there  was  the\noccasional eruption of temper, an occurrence not uncommon around his son, Paul would\nimpart some of his calm. “What’s the matter?” he would say. “You got a feather up your\nass?” In return he occasionally asked to borrow back the TV set so he could watch the\nend of a football game. During some of these breaks, Jobs and Kottke would go outside\nand play guitar on the lawn.\nClara Jobs didn’t mind losing most of her house to piles of parts and houseguests,\nbut she was frustrated by her son’s increasingly quirky diets. “She would roll her eyes\nat his latest eating obsessions,” recalled Holmes. “She just wanted him to be healthy,\nand he would be making weird pronouncements like, ‘I’m a fruitarian and I will only eat\nleaves picked by virgins in the moonlight.’”\nAfter a dozen assembled boards had been approved by Wozniak, Jobs drove them\nover to the Byte Shop. Terrell was a bit taken aback. There was no power supply, case,\nmonitor, or keyboard. He had expected something more finished. But Jobs stared him\ndown, and he agreed to take delivery and pay.\nAfter thirty days Apple was on the verge of being profitable. “We were able to build\nthe boards more cheaply than we thought, because I got a good deal on parts,” Jobs\nrecalled. “So the fifty we sold to the Byte Shop almost paid for all the material we\nneeded to make a hundred boards.” Now they could make a real profit by selling the\nremaining fifty to their friends and Homebrew compatriots.\nElizabeth Holmes officially became the part-time bookkeeper at $4 an hour, driving\ndown from San Francisco once a week and figuring out how to port Jobs’s checkbook\ninto  a  ledger.  In  order  to  make  Apple  seem  like  a  real  company,  Jobs  hired  an\nanswering service, which would relay messages to his mother. Ron Wayne drew a logo,\nusing the ornate line-drawing style of Victorian illustrated fiction, that featured Newton\nsitting under a tree framed by a quote from Wordsworth: “A mind forever voyaging\nthrough strange seas of thought, alone.” It was a rather odd motto, one that fit Wayne’s\nself-image more than Apple Computer. Perhaps a better Wordsworth line would have\nbeen the poet’s description of those involved in the start of the French Revolution:\n“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive / But to be young was very heaven!” As Wozniak\n\nlater exulted, “We were participating in the biggest revolution that had ever happened, I\nthought. I was so happy to be a part of it.”\nWoz had already begun thinking about the next version of the machine, so they started\ncalling their current model the Apple I. Jobs and Woz would drive up and down Camino\nReal trying to get the electronics stores to sell it. In addition to the fifty sold by the Byte\nShop and almost fifty sold to friends, they were building another hundred for retail\noutlets. Not surprisingly, they had contradictory impulses: Wozniak wanted to sell them\nfor about what it cost to build them, but Jobs wanted to make a serious profit. Jobs\nprevailed. He picked a retail price that was about three times what it cost to build the\nboards and a 33% markup over the $500 wholesale price that Terrell and other stores\npaid. The result was $666.66. “I was always into repeating digits,” Wozniak said. “The\nphone number for my dial-a-joke service was 255-6666.” Neither of them knew that in\nthe Book of Revelation 666 symbolized the “number of the beast,” but they soon were\nfaced with complaints, especially after 666 was featured in that year’s hit movie, The\nOmen. (In 2010 one of the original Apple I computers was sold at auction by Christie’s\nfor $213,000.)\nThe  first  feature  story  on  the  new  machine  appeared  in  the  July  1976  issue  of\nInterface, a now-defunct hobbyist magazine. Jobs and friends were still making them by\nhand in his house, but the article referred to him as the director of marketing and “a\nformer private consultant to Atari.” It made Apple sound like a real company. “Steve\ncommunicates with many of the computer clubs to keep his finger on the heartbeat of this\nyoung industry,” the article reported, and it quoted him explaining, “If we can rap about\ntheir needs, feelings and motivations, we can respond appropriately by giving them\nwhat they want.”\nBy this time they had other competitors, in addition to the Altair, most notably the\nIMSAI 8080 and Processor Technology Corporation’s SOL-20. The latter was designed\nby Lee Felsenstein and Gordon French of the Homebrew Computer Club. They all had\nthe chance to go on display during Labor Day weekend of 1976, at the first annual\nPersonal Computer Festival, held in a tired hotel on the decaying boardwalk of Atlantic\nCity, New Jersey. Jobs and Wozniak took a TWA flight to Philadelphia, cradling one\ncigar box with the Apple I and another with the prototype for the successor that Woz\nwas working on. Sitting in the row behind them was Felsenstein, who looked at the\nApple I and pronounced it “thoroughly unimpressive.” Wozniak was unnerved by the\nconversation in the row behind him. “We could hear them talking in advanced business\ntalk,” he recalled, “using businesslike acronyms we’d never heard before.”\nWozniak spent most of his time in their hotel room, tweaking his new prototype. He\nwas too shy to stand at the card table that Apple had been assigned near the back of the\nexhibition hall. Daniel Kottke had taken the train down from Manhattan, where he was\nnow  attending  Columbia,  and  he  manned  the  table  while  Jobs  walked  the  floor  to\ninspect the competition. What he saw did not impress him. Wozniak, he felt reassured,\nwas the best circuit engineer, and the Apple I (and surely its successor) could beat the\n\ncompetition in terms of functionality. However, the SOL-20 was better looking. It had a\nsleek metal case, a keyboard, a power supply, and cables. It looked as if it had been\nproduced by grown-ups. The Apple I, on the other hand, appeared as scruffy as its\ncreators.\n\nCHAPTER SIX\nTHE APPLE II\nDawn of a New Age\nAn Integrated Package\nAs Jobs walked the floor of the Personal Computer Festival, he came to the realization\nthat Paul Terrell of the Byte Shop had been right: Personal computers should come in a\ncomplete package. The next Apple, he decided, needed to have a great case and a built-\nin keyboard, and be integrated end to end, from the power supply to the software. “My\nvision was to create the first fully packaged computer,” he recalled. “We were no\nlonger aiming for the handful of hobbyists who liked to assemble their own computers,\nwho knew how to buy transformers and keyboards. For every one of them there were a\nthousand people who would want the machine to be ready to run.”\nIn their hotel room on that Labor Day weekend of 1976, Wozniak tinkered with the\nprototype of the new machine, to be named the Apple II, that Jobs hoped would take\nthem to this next level. They brought the prototype out only once, late at night, to test it\non the color projection television in one of the conference rooms. Wozniak had come up\n\nwith an ingenious way to goose the machine’s chips into creating color, and he wanted\nto see if it would work on the type of television that uses a projector to display on a\nmovie-like screen. “I figured a projector might have a different color circuitry that\nwould choke on my color method,” he recalled. “So I hooked up the Apple II to this\nprojector and it worked perfectly.” As he typed on his keyboard, colorful lines and\nswirls burst on the screen across the room. The only outsider who saw this first Apple\nII was Jim Taylor, a sales manager for the VideoBeam television projector. He said he\nhad looked at all the machines, and this was the one he would be buying.\nTo produce the fully packaged Apple II would require significant capital, so they\nconsidered selling the rights to a larger company. Jobs went to Al Alcorn and asked for\nthe chance to pitch it to Atari’s management. He set up a meeting with the company’s\npresident, Joe Keenan, who was a lot more conservative than Alcorn and Bushnell.\n“Steve goes in to pitch him, but Joe couldn’t stand him,” Alcorn recalled. “He didn’t\nappreciate Steve’s hygiene.” Jobs was barefoot, and at one point put his feet up on a\ndesk. “Not only are we not going to buy this thing,” Keenan shouted, “but get your feet\noff my desk!” Alcorn recalled thinking, “Oh, well. There goes that possibility.”\nIn September Chuck Peddle of the Commodore computer company came by the Jobs\nhouse to get a demo. “We’d opened Steve’s garage to the sunlight, and he came in\nwearing a suit and a cowboy hat,” Wozniak recalled. Peddle loved the Apple II, and he\narranged a presentation for his top brass a few weeks later at Commodore headquarters.\n“You might want to buy us for a few hundred thousand dollars,” Jobs said when they got\nthere. Wozniak was stunned by this “ridiculous” suggestion, but Jobs persisted. The\nCommodore honchos called a few days later to say they had decided it would be\ncheaper  to  build  their  own  machine.  Jobs  was  not  upset.  He  had  checked  out\nCommodore and decided that he didn’t like its leadership. Wozniak did not rue the lost\nmoney, but his engineering sensibilities were offended when the company came out with\nthe Commodore PET nine months later. “It kind of sickened me. They made a real\ncrappy product by doing it so quick. They could have had Apple.”\nThe Commodore flirtation brought to the surface a potential conflict between Jobs\nand Wozniak: Were they truly equal in what they contributed to Apple and what they\nshould get out of it? Jerry Wozniak, who exalted the value of engineers over mere\nentrepreneurs and marketers, thought most of the money should be going to his son. He\nconfronted Jobs personally when he came by the Wozniak house. “You don’t deserve\nshit,” he told Jobs. “You haven’t produced anything.” Jobs began to cry, which was not\nunusual. He had never been, and would never be, adept at containing his emotions. He\ntold Steve Wozniak that he was willing to call off the partnership. “If we’re not fifty-\nfifty,”  he  said  to  his  friend,  “you  can  have  the  whole  thing.”  Wozniak,  however,\nunderstood better than his father the symbiosis they had. If it had not been for Jobs, he\nmight still be handing out schematics of his boards for free at the back of Homebrew\nmeetings. It was Jobs who had turned his ingenious designs into a budding business, just\nas he had with the Blue Box. He agreed they should remain partners.\n\nIt  was  a  smart  call.  To  make  the  Apple  II  successful  required  more  than  just\nWozniak’s awesome circuit design. It would need to be packaged into a fully integrated\nconsumer product, and that was Jobs’s role.\nHe began by asking their erstwhile partner Ron Wayne to design a case. “I assumed\nthey had no money, so I did one that didn’t require any tooling and could be fabricated\nin a standard metal shop,” he said. His design called for a Plexiglas cover attached by\nmetal straps and a rolltop door that slid down over the keyboard.\nJobs didn’t like it. He wanted a simple and elegant design, which he hoped would\nset Apple apart from the other machines, with their clunky gray metal cases. While\nhaunting the appliance aisles at Macy’s, he was struck by the Cuisinart food processors\nand decided that he wanted a sleek case made of light molded plastic. At a Homebrew\nmeeting, he offered a local consultant, Jerry Manock, $1,500 to produce such a design.\nManock, dubious about Jobs’s appearance, asked for the money up front. Jobs refused,\nbut Manock took the job anyway. Within weeks he had produced a simple foam-molded\nplastic case that was uncluttered and exuded friendliness. Jobs was thrilled.\nNext came the power supply. Digital geeks like Wozniak paid little attention to\nsomething  so  analog  and  mundane,  but  Jobs  decided  it  was  a  key  component.  In\nparticular he wanted—as he would his entire career—to provide power in a way that\navoided the need for a fan. Fans inside computers were not Zen-like; they distracted. He\ndropped  by  Atari  to  consult  with  Alcorn,  who  knew  old-fashioned  electrical\nengineering. “Al turned me on to this brilliant guy named Rod Holt, who was a chain-\nsmoking  Marxist  who  had  been  through  many  marriages  and  was  an  expert  on\neverything,” Jobs recalled. Like Manock and others meeting Jobs for the first time, Holt\ntook a look at him and was skeptical. “I’m expensive,” Holt said. Jobs sensed he was\nworth it and said that cost was no problem. “He just conned me into working,” said\nHolt, who ended up joining Apple full-time.\nInstead of a conventional linear power supply, Holt built one like those used in\noscilloscopes.  It  switched  the  power  on  and  off  not  sixty  times  per  second,  but\nthousands of times; this allowed it to store the power for far less time, and thus throw\noff less heat. “That switching power supply was as revolutionary as the Apple II logic\nboard was,” Jobs later said. “Rod doesn’t get a lot of credit for this in the history\nbooks, but he should. Every computer now uses switching power supplies, and they all\nrip off Rod’s design.” For all of Wozniak’s brilliance, this was not something he could\nhave done. “I only knew vaguely what a switching power supply was,” Woz admitted.\nJobs’s father had once taught him that a drive for perfection meant caring about the\ncraftsmanship even of the parts unseen. Jobs applied that to the layout of the circuit\nboard inside the Apple II. He rejected the initial design because the lines were not\nstraight enough.\nThis passion for perfection led him to indulge his instinct to control. Most hackers\nand hobbyists liked to customize, modify, and jack various things into their computers.\nTo Jobs, this was a threat to a seamless end-to-end user experience. Wozniak, a hacker\n\nat heart, disagreed. He wanted to include eight slots on the Apple II for users to insert\nwhatever smaller circuit boards and peripherals they might want. Jobs insisted there be\nonly two, for a printer and a modem. “Usually I’m really easy to get along with, but this\ntime I told him, ‘If that’s what you want, go get yourself another computer,’” Wozniak\nrecalled. “I knew that people like me would eventually come up with things to add to\nany computer.” Wozniak won the argument that time, but he could sense his power\nwaning. “I was in a position to do that then. I wouldn’t always be.”\nMike Markkula\nAll of this required money. “The tooling of this plastic case was going to cost, like,\n$100,000,” Jobs said. “Just to get this whole thing into production was going to be, like,\n$200,000.” He went back to Nolan Bushnell, this time to get him to put in some money\nand take a minority equity stake. “He asked me if I would put $50,000 in and he would\ngive me a third of the company,” said Bushnell. “I was so smart, I said no. It’s kind of\nfun to think about that, when I’m not crying.”\nBushnell suggested that Jobs try Don Valentine, a straight-shooting former marketing\nmanager at National Semiconductor who had founded Sequoia Capital, a pioneering\nventure capital firm. Valentine arrived at the Jobses’ garage in a Mercedes wearing a\nblue suit, button-down shirt, and rep tie. His first impression was that Jobs looked and\nsmelled odd. “Steve was trying to be the embodiment of the counterculture. He had a\nwispy beard, was very thin, and looked like Ho Chi Minh.”\nValentine, however, did not become a preeminent Silicon Valley investor by relying\non surface appearances. What bothered him more was that Jobs knew nothing about\nmarketing and seemed content to peddle his product to individual stores one by one. “If\nyou want me to finance you,” Valentine told him, “you need to have one person as a\npartner who understands marketing and distribution and can write a business plan.”\nJobs tended to be either bristly or solicitous when older people offered him advice.\nWith Valentine he was the latter. “Send me three suggestions,” he replied. Valentine did,\nJobs met them, and he clicked with one of them, a man named Mike Markkula, who\nwould end up playing a critical role at Apple for the next two decades.\nMarkkula was only thirty-three, but he had already retired after working at Fairchild\nand then Intel, where he made millions on his stock options when the chip maker went\npublic. He was a cautious and shrewd man, with the precise moves of someone who\nhad been a gymnast in high school, and he excelled at figuring out pricing strategies,\ndistribution networks, marketing, and finance. Despite being slightly reserved, he had a\nflashy side when it came to enjoying his newly minted wealth. He built himself a house\nin Lake Tahoe and later an outsize mansion in the hills of Woodside. When he showed\nup for his first meeting at Jobs’s garage, he was driving not a dark Mercedes like\n\nValentine,  but  a  highly  polished  gold  Corvette  convertible.  “When  I  arrived  at  the\ngarage, Woz was at the workbench and immediately began showing off the Apple II,”\nMarkkula recalled. “I looked past the fact that both guys needed a haircut and was\namazed by what I saw on that workbench. You can always get a haircut.”\nJobs immediately liked Markkula. “He was short and he had been passed over for\nthe top marketing job at Intel, which I suspect made him want to prove himself.” He also\nstruck Jobs as decent and fair. “You could tell that if he could screw you, he wouldn’t.\nHe had a real moral sense to him.” Wozniak was equally impressed. “I thought he was\nthe nicest person ever,” he recalled. “Better still, he actually liked what we had!”\nMarkkula proposed to Jobs that they write a business plan together. “If it comes out\nwell, I’ll invest,” Markkula said, “and if not, you’ve got a few weeks of my time for\nfree.” Jobs began going to Markkula’s house in the evenings, kicking around projections\nand talking through the night. “We made a lot of assumptions, such as about how many\nhouses would have a personal computer, and there were nights we were up until 4\na.m.,” Jobs recalled. Markkula ended up writing most of the plan. “Steve would say, ‘I\nwill bring you this section next time,’ but he usually didn’t deliver on time, so I ended\nup doing it.”\nMarkkula’s plan envisioned ways of getting beyond the hobbyist market. “He talked\nabout introducing the computer to regular people in regular homes, doing things like\nkeeping track of your favorite recipes or balancing your checkbook,” Wozniak recalled.\nMarkkula made a wild prediction: “We’re going to be a Fortune 500 company in two\nyears,” he said. “This is the start of an industry. It happens once in a decade.” It would\ntake Apple seven years to break into the Fortune 500, but the spirit of Markkula’s\nprediction turned out to be true.\nMarkkula offered to guarantee a line of credit of up to $250,000 in return for being\nmade a one-third equity participant. Apple would incorporate, and he along with Jobs\nand Wozniak would each own 26% of the stock. The rest would be reserved to attract\nfuture investors. The three met in the cabana by Markkula’s swimming pool and sealed\nthe deal. “I thought it was unlikely that Mike would ever see that $250,000 again, and I\nwas impressed that he was willing to risk it,” Jobs recalled.\nNow it was necessary to convince Wozniak to come on board full-time. “Why can’t I\nkeep doing this on the side and just have HP as my secure job for life?” he asked.\nMarkkula said that wouldn’t work, and he gave Wozniak a deadline of a few days to\ndecide. “I felt very insecure in starting a company where I would be expected to push\npeople around and control what they did,” Wozniak recalled. “I’d decided long ago that\nI would never become someone authoritative.” So he went to Markkula’s cabana and\nannounced that he was not leaving HP.\nMarkkula shrugged and said okay. But Jobs got very upset. He cajoled Wozniak; he\ngot friends to try to convince him; he cried, yelled, and threw a couple of fits. He even\nwent to Wozniak’s parents’ house, burst into tears, and asked Jerry for help. By this\npoint Wozniak’s father had realized there was real money to be made by capitalizing on\n\nthe Apple II, and he joined forces on Jobs’s behalf. “I started getting phone calls at\nwork and home from my dad, my mom, my brother, and various friends,” Wozniak\nrecalled. “Every one of them told me I’d made the wrong decision.” None of that\nworked. Then Allen Baum, their Buck Fry Club mate at Homestead High, called. “You\nreally ought to go ahead and do it,” he said. He argued that if he joined Apple full-time,\nhe would not have to go into management or give up being an engineer. “That was\nexactly what I needed to hear,” Wozniak later said. “I could stay at the bottom of the\norganization chart, as an engineer.” He called Jobs and declared that he was now ready\nto come on board.\nOn January 3, 1977, the new corporation, the Apple Computer Co., was officially\ncreated, and it bought out the old partnership that had been formed by Jobs and Wozniak\nnine  months  earlier.  Few  people  noticed.  That  month  the  Homebrew  surveyed  its\nmembers and found that, of the 181 who owned personal computers, only six owned an\nApple. Jobs was convinced, however, that the Apple II would change that.\nMarkkula would become a father figure to Jobs. Like Jobs’s adoptive father, he\nwould  indulge  Jobs’s  strong  will,  and  like  his  biological  father,  he  would  end  up\nabandoning him. “Markkula was as much a father-son relationship as Steve ever had,”\nsaid the venture capitalist Arthur Rock. He began to teach Jobs about marketing and\nsales. “Mike really took me under his wing,” Jobs recalled. “His values were much\naligned with mine. He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal\nof getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a\ncompany that will last.”\nMarkkula wrote his principles in a one-page paper titled “The Apple Marketing\nPhilosophy” that stressed three points. The first was empathy, an intimate connection\nwith the feelings of the customer: “We will truly understand their needs better than any\nother company.” The second was focus: “In order to do a good job of those things that\nwe decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.” The third and\nequally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute. It emphasized that people\nform an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys.\n“People DO judge a book by its cover,” he wrote. “We may have the best product, the\nhighest quality, the most useful software etc.; if we present them in a slipshod manner,\nthey  will  be  perceived  as  slipshod;  if  we  present  them  in  a  creative,  professional\nmanner, we will impute the desired qualities.”\nFor the rest of his career, Jobs would understand the needs and desires of customers\nbetter than any other business leader, he would focus on a handful of core products, and\nhe would care, sometimes obsessively, about marketing and image and even the details\nof packaging. “When you open the box of an iPhone or iPad, we want that tactile\nexperience to set the tone for how you perceive the product,” he said. “Mike taught me\nthat.”\n\nRegis McKenna\nThe first step in this process was convincing the Valley’s premier publicist, Regis\nMcKenna, to take on Apple as a client. McKenna was from a large working-class\nPittsburgh family, and bred into his bones was a steeliness that he cloaked with charm.\nA college dropout, he had worked for Fairchild and National Semiconductor before\nstarting his own PR and advertising firm. His two specialties were doling out exclusive\ninterviews  with  his  clients  to  journalists  he  had  cultivated  and  coming  up  with\nmemorable ad campaigns that created brand awareness for products such as microchips.\nOne of these was a series of colorful magazine ads for Intel that featured racing cars and\npoker chips rather than the usual dull performance charts. These caught Jobs’s eye. He\ncalled Intel and asked who created them. “Regis McKenna,” he was told. “I asked them\nwhat Regis McKenna was,” Jobs recalled, “and they told me he was a person.” When\nJobs phoned, he couldn’t get through to McKenna. Instead he was transferred to Frank\nBurge, an account executive, who tried to put him off. Jobs called back almost every\nday.\nBurge finally agreed to drive out to the Jobs garage. “Holy Christ, this guy is going\nto be something else,” he recalled thinking. “What’s the least amount of time I can spend\nwith this clown without being rude.” Then, when he was confronted with the unwashed\nand shaggy Jobs, two things hit him: “First, he was an incredibly smart young man.\nSecond, I didn’t understand a fiftieth of what he was talking about.”\nSo Jobs and Wozniak were invited to have a meeting with, as his impish business\ncards read, “Regis McKenna, himself.” This time it was the normally shy Wozniak who\nbecame prickly. McKenna glanced at an article Wozniak was writing about Apple and\nsuggested that it was too technical and needed to be livened up. “I don’t want any PR\nman touching my copy,” Wozniak snapped. McKenna suggested it was time for them to\nleave his office. “But Steve called me back right away and said he wanted to meet\nagain,” McKenna recalled. “This time he came without Woz, and we hit it off.”\nMcKenna had his team get to work on brochures for the Apple II. The first thing they\ndid was to replace Ron Wayne’s ornate Victorian woodcut-style logo, which ran counter\nto McKenna’s colorful and playful advertising style. So an art director, Rob Janoff, was\nassigned to create a new one. “Don’t make it cute,” Jobs ordered. Janoff came up with a\nsimple apple shape in two versions, one whole and the other with a bite taken out of it.\nThe first looked too much like a cherry, so Jobs chose the one with a bite. He also\npicked a version that was striped in six colors, with psychedelic hues sandwiched\nbetween  whole-earth  green  and  sky  blue,  even  though  that  made  printing  the  logo\nsignificantly more expensive. Atop the brochure McKenna put a maxim, often attributed\nto  Leonardo  da  Vinci,  that  would  become  the  defining  precept  of  Jobs’s  design\nphilosophy: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”\n\nThe First Launch Event\nThe introduction of the Apple II was scheduled to coincide with the first West Coast\nComputer Faire, to be held in April 1977 in San Francisco, organized by a Homebrew\nstalwart,  Jim  Warren.  Jobs  signed  Apple  up  for  a  booth  as  soon  as  he  got  the\ninformation packet. He wanted to secure a location right at the front of the hall as a\ndramatic way to launch the Apple II, and so he shocked Wozniak by paying $5,000 in\nadvance. “Steve decided that this was our big launch,” said Wozniak. “We would show\nthe world we had a great machine and a great company.”\nIt was an application of Markkula’s admonition that it was important to “impute”\nyour  greatness  by  making  a  memorable  impression  on  people,  especially  when\nlaunching a new product. That was reflected in the care that Jobs took with Apple’s\ndisplay area. Other exhibitors had card tables and poster board signs. Apple had a\ncounter draped in black velvet and a large pane of backlit Plexiglas with Janoff’s new\nlogo. They put on display the only three Apple IIs that had been finished, but empty\nboxes were piled up to give the impression that there were many more on hand.\nJobs was furious that the computer cases had arrived with tiny blemishes on them, so\nhe had his handful of employees sand and polish them. The imputing even extended to\ngussying up Jobs and Wozniak. Markkula sent them to a San Francisco tailor for three-\npiece suits, which looked faintly ridiculous on them, like tuxes on teenagers. “Markkula\nexplained how we would all have to dress up nicely, how we should appear and look,\nhow we should act,” Wozniak recalled.\nIt was worth the effort. The Apple II looked solid yet friendly in its sleek beige case,\nunlike the intimidating metal-clad machines and naked boards on the other tables. Apple\ngot three hundred orders at the show, and Jobs met a Japanese textile maker, Mizushima\nSatoshi, who became Apple’s first dealer in Japan.\nThe  fancy  clothes  and  Markkula’s  injunctions  could  not,  however,  stop  the\nirrepressible  Wozniak  from  playing  some  practical  jokes.  One  program  that  he\ndisplayed tried to guess people’s nationality from their last name and then produced the\nrelevant  ethnic  jokes.  He  also  created  and  distributed  a  hoax  brochure  for  a  new\ncomputer called the “Zaltair,” with all sorts of fake ad-copy superlatives like “Imagine\na car with five wheels.” Jobs briefly fell for the joke and even took pride that the Apple\nII stacked up well against the Zaltair in the comparison chart. He didn’t realize who had\npulled  the  prank  until  eight  years  later,  when  Woz  gave  him  a  framed  copy  of  the\nbrochure as a birthday gift.\nMike Scott\n\nApple was now a real company, with a dozen employees, a line of credit, and the daily\npressures that can come from customers and suppliers. It had even moved out of the\nJobses’ garage, finally, into a rented office on Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino,\nabout a mile from where Jobs and Wozniak went to high school.\nJobs  did  not  wear  his  growing  responsibilities  gracefully.  He  had  always  been\ntemperamental and bratty. At Atari his behavior had caused him to be banished to the\nnight shift, but at Apple that was not possible. “He became increasingly tyrannical and\nsharp in his criticism,” according to Markkula. “He would tell people, ‘That design\nlooks like shit.’” He was particularly rough on Wozniak’s young programmers, Randy\nWigginton and Chris Espinosa. “Steve would come in, take a quick look at what I had\ndone, and tell me it was shit without having any idea what it was or why I had done it,”\nsaid Wigginton, who was just out of high school.\nThere  was  also  the  issue  of  his  hygiene.  He  was  still  convinced,  against  all\nevidence, that his vegan diets meant that he didn’t need to use a deodorant or take\nregular showers. “We would have to literally put him out the door and tell him to go\ntake  a  shower,”  said  Markkula.  “At  meetings  we  had  to  look  at  his  dirty  feet.”\nSometimes, to relieve stress, he would soak his feet in the toilet, a practice that was not\nas soothing for his colleagues.\nMarkkula was averse to confrontation, so he decided to bring in a president, Mike\nScott, to keep a tighter rein on Jobs. Markkula and Scott had joined Fairchild on the\nsame day in 1967, had adjoining offices, and shared the same birthday, which they\ncelebrated together each year. At their birthday lunch in February 1977, when Scott was\nturning thirty-two, Markkula invited him to become Apple’s new president.\nOn paper he looked like a great choice. He was running a manufacturing line for\nNational  Semiconductor,  and  he  had  the  advantage  of  being  a  manager  who  fully\nunderstood engineering. In person, however, he had some quirks. He was overweight,\nafflicted with tics and health problems, and so tightly wound that he wandered the halls\nwith clenched fists. He also could be argumentative. In dealing with Jobs, that could be\ngood or bad.\nWozniak quickly embraced the idea of hiring Scott. Like Markkula, he hated dealing\nwith the conflicts that Jobs engendered. Jobs, not surprisingly, had more conflicted\nemotions. “I was only twenty-two, and I knew I wasn’t ready to run a real company,” he\nsaid. “But Apple was my baby, and I didn’t want to give it up.” Relinquishing any\ncontrol was agonizing to him. He wrestled with the issue over long lunches at Bob’s Big\nBoy hamburgers (Woz’s favorite place) and at the Good Earth restaurant (Jobs’s). He\nfinally acquiesced, reluctantly.\nMike Scott, called “Scotty” to distinguish him from Mike Markkula, had one primary\nduty:  managing  Jobs.  This  was  usually  accomplished  by  Jobs’s  preferred  mode  of\nmeeting, which was taking a walk together. “My very first walk was to tell him to bathe\nmore often,” Scott recalled. “He said that in exchange I had to read his fruitarian diet\nbook and consider it as a way to lose weight.” Scott never adopted the diet or lost much\n\nweight, and Jobs made only minor modifications to his hygiene. “Steve was adamant\nthat he bathed once a week, and that was adequate as long as he was eating a fruitarian\ndiet.”\nJobs’s desire for control and disdain for authority was destined to be a problem with\nthe man who was brought in to be his regent, especially when Jobs discovered that Scott\nwas one of the only people he had yet encountered who would not bend to his will.\n“The question between Steve and me was who could be most stubborn, and I was pretty\ngood at that,” Scott said. “He needed to be sat on, and he sure didn’t like that.” Jobs\nlater said, “I never yelled at anyone more than I yelled at Scotty.”\nAn  early  showdown  came  over  employee  badge  numbers.  Scott  assigned  #1  to\nWozniak and #2 to Jobs. Not surprisingly, Jobs demanded to be #1. “I wouldn’t let him\nhave it, because that would stoke his ego even more,” said Scott. Jobs threw a tantrum,\neven cried. Finally, he proposed a solution. He would have badge #0. Scott relented, at\nleast for the purpose of the badge, but the Bank of America required a positive integer\nfor its payroll system and Jobs’s remained #2.\nThere was a more fundamental disagreement that went beyond personal petulance.\nJay Elliot, who was hired by Jobs after a chance meeting in a restaurant, noted Jobs’s\nsalient  trait:  “His  obsession  is  a  passion  for  the  product,  a  passion  for  product\nperfection.” Mike Scott, on the other hand, never let a passion for the perfect take\nprecedence  over  pragmatism.  The  design  of  the  Apple  II  case  was  one  of  many\nexamples. The Pantone company, which Apple used to specify colors for its plastic, had\nmore than two thousand shades of beige. “None of them were good enough for Steve,”\nScott marveled. “He wanted to create a different shade, and I had to stop him.” When\nthe time came to tweak the design of the case, Jobs spent days agonizing over just how\nrounded the corners should be. “I didn’t care how rounded they were,” said Scott, “I\njust wanted it decided.” Another dispute was over engineering benches. Scott wanted a\nstandard gray; Jobs insisted on special-order benches that were pure white. All of this\nfinally led to a showdown in front of Markkula about whether Jobs or Scott had the\npower to sign purchase orders; Markkula sided with Scott. Jobs also insisted that Apple\nbe different in how it treated customers. He wanted a one-year warranty to come with\nthe Apple II. This flabbergasted Scott; the usual warranty was ninety days. Again Jobs\ndissolved into tears during one of their arguments over the issue. They walked around\nthe parking lot to calm down, and Scott decided to relent on this one.\nWozniak began to rankle at Jobs’s style. “Steve was too tough on people. I wanted\nour company to feel like a family where we all had fun and shared whatever we made.”\nJobs, for his part, felt that Wozniak simply would not grow up. “He was very childlike.\nHe did a great version of BASIC, but then never could buckle down and write the\nfloating-point BASIC we needed, so we ended up later having to make a deal with\nMicrosoft. He was just too unfocused.”\nBut for the time being the personality clashes were manageable, mainly because the\ncompany was doing so well. Ben Rosen, the analyst whose newsletters shaped the\n\nopinions of the tech world, became an enthusiastic proselytizer for the Apple II. An\nindependent developer came up with the first spreadsheet and personal finance program\nfor personal computers, VisiCalc, and for a while it was available only on the Apple II,\nturning the computer into something that businesses and families could justify buying.\nThe  company  began  attracting  influential  new  investors.  The  pioneering  venture\ncapitalist Arthur Rock had initially been unimpressed when Markkula sent Jobs to see\nhim. “He looked as if he had just come back from seeing that guru he had in India,”\nRock recalled, “and he kind of smelled that way too.” But after Rock scoped out the\nApple II, he made an investment and joined the board.\nThe Apple II would be marketed, in various models, for the next sixteen years, with\nclose  to  six  million  sold.  More  than  any  other  machine,  it  launched  the  personal\ncomputer  industry.  Wozniak  deserves  the  historic  credit  for  the  design  of  its  awe-\ninspiring circuit board and related operating software, which was one of the era’s great\nfeats of solo invention. But Jobs was the one who integrated Wozniak’s boards into a\nfriendly package, from the power supply to the sleek case. He also created the company\nthat  sprang  up  around  Wozniak’s  machines.  As  Regis  McKenna  later  said,  “Woz\ndesigned a great machine, but it would be sitting in hobby shops today were it not for\nSteve  Jobs.”  Nevertheless  most  people  considered  the  Apple  II  to  be  Wozniak’s\ncreation. That would spur Jobs to pursue the next great advance, one that he could call\nhis own.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nCHRISANN AND LISA\nHe Who Is Abandoned ...\nEver since they had lived together in a cabin during the summer after he graduated from\nhigh school, Chrisann Brennan had woven in and out of Jobs’s life. When he returned\nfrom India in 1974, they spent time together at Robert Friedland’s farm. “Steve invited\nme up there, and we were just young and easy and free,” she recalled. “There was an\nenergy there that went to my heart.”\nWhen they moved back to Los Altos, their relationship drifted into being, for the\nmost part, merely friendly. He lived at home and worked at Atari; she had a small\napartment and spent a lot of time at Kobun Chino’s Zen center. By early 1975 she had\nbegun a relationship with a mutual friend, Greg Calhoun. “She was with Greg, but went\nback to Steve occasionally,” according to Elizabeth Holmes. “That was pretty much the\nway it was with all of us. We were sort of shifting back and forth; it was the seventies,\nafter all.”\nCalhoun  had  been  at  Reed  with  Jobs,  Friedland,  Kottke,  and  Holmes.  Like  the\nothers, he became deeply involved with Eastern spirituality, dropped out of Reed, and\nfound  his  way  to  Friedland’s  farm.  There  he  moved  into  an  eight-  by  twenty-foot\nchicken coop that he converted into a little house by raising it onto cinderblocks and\nbuilding a sleeping loft inside. In the spring of 1975 Brennan moved in with him, and\nthe next year they decided to make their own pilgrimage to India. Jobs advised Calhoun\nnot to take Brennan with him, saying that she would interfere with his spiritual quest, but\nthey went together anyway. “I was just so impressed by what happened to Steve on his\ntrip to India that I wanted to go there,” she said.\nTheirs was a serious trip, beginning in March 1976 and lasting almost a year. At one\npoint they ran out of money, so Calhoun hitchhiked to Iran to teach English in Tehran.\nBrennan stayed in India, and when Calhoun’s teaching stint was over they hitchhiked to\n\nmeet each other in the middle, in Afghanistan. The world was a very different place\nback then.\nAfter a while their relationship frayed, and they returned from India separately. By\nthe summer of 1977 Brennan had moved back to Los Altos, where she lived for a while\nin a tent on the grounds of Kobun Chino’s Zen center. By this time Jobs had moved out\nof  his  parents’  house  and  was  renting  a  $600  per  month  suburban  ranch  house  in\nCupertino with Daniel Kottke. It was an odd scene of free-spirited hippie types living in\na tract house they dubbed Rancho Suburbia. “It was a four-bedroom house, and we\noccasionally rented one of the bedrooms out to all sorts of crazy people, including a\nstripper for a while,” recalled Jobs. Kottke couldn’t quite figure out why Jobs had not\njust gotten his own house, which he could have afforded by then. “I think he just wanted\nto have a roommate,” Kottke speculated.\nEven though her relationship with Jobs was sporadic, Brennan soon moved in as\nwell. This made for a set of living arrangements worthy of a French farce. The house\nhad two big bedrooms and two tiny ones. Jobs, not surprisingly, commandeered the\nlargest of them, and Brennan (who was not really living with him) moved into the other\nbig bedroom. “The two middle rooms were like for babies, and I didn’t want either of\nthem, so I moved into the living room and slept on a foam pad,” said Kottke. They\nturned one of the small rooms into space for meditating and dropping acid, like the attic\nspace they had used at Reed. It was filled with foam packing material from Apple\nboxes. “Neighborhood kids used to come over and we would toss them in it and it was\ngreat fun,” said Kottke, “but then Chrisann brought home some cats who peed in the\nfoam, and then we had to get rid of it.”\nLiving in the house at times rekindled the physical relationship between Brennan and\nJobs, and within a few months she was pregnant. “Steve and I were in and out of a\nrelationship for five years before I got pregnant,” she said. “We didn’t know how to be\ntogether and we didn’t know how to be apart.” When Greg Calhoun hitchhiked from\nColorado to visit them on Thanksgiving 1977, Brennan told him the news: “Steve and I\ngot back together, and now I’m pregnant, but now we are on again and off again, and I\ndon’t know what to do.”\nCalhoun noticed that Jobs was disconnected from the whole situation. He even tried\nto convince Calhoun to stay with them and come to work at Apple. “Steve was just not\ndealing with Chrisann or the pregnancy,” he recalled. “He could be very engaged with\nyou  in  one  moment,  but  then  very  disengaged.  There  was  a  side  to  him  that  was\nfrighteningly cold.”\nWhen Jobs did not want to deal with a distraction, he sometimes just ignored it, as if\nhe could will it out of existence. At times he was able to distort reality not just for\nothers but even for himself. In the case of Brennan’s pregnancy, he simply shut it out of\nhis mind. When confronted, he would deny that he knew he was the father, even though\nhe admitted that he had been sleeping with her. “I wasn’t sure it was my kid, because I\nwas pretty sure I wasn’t the only one she was sleeping with,” he told me later. “She and\n\nI were not really even going out when she got pregnant. She just had a room in our\nhouse.” Brennan had no doubt that Jobs was the father. She had not been involved with\nGreg or any other men at the time.\nWas he lying to himself, or did he not know that he was the father? “I just think he\ncouldn’t access that part of his brain or the idea of being responsible,” Kottke said.\nElizabeth Holmes agreed: “He considered the option of parenthood and considered the\noption of not being a parent, and he decided to believe the latter. He had other plans for\nhis life.”\nThere was no discussion of marriage. “I knew that she was not the person I wanted\nto marry, and we would never be happy, and it wouldn’t last long,” Jobs later said. “I\nwas all in favor of her getting an abortion, but she didn’t know what to do. She thought\nabout it repeatedly and decided not to, or I don’t know that she ever really decided—I\nthink time just decided for her.” Brennan told me that it was her choice to have the baby:\n“He said he was fine with an abortion but never pushed for it.” Interestingly, given his\nown background, he was adamantly against one option. “He strongly discouraged me\nputting the child up for adoption,” she said.\nThere was a disturbing irony. Jobs and Brennan were both twenty-three, the same\nage that Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali had been when they had Jobs. He had\nnot yet tracked down his biological parents, but his adoptive parents had told him some\nof their tale. “I didn’t know then about this coincidence of our ages, so it didn’t affect\nmy discussions with Chrisann,” he later said. He dismissed the notion that he was\nsomehow following his biological father’s pattern of getting his girlfriend pregnant\nwhen he was twenty-three, but he did admit that the ironic resonance gave him pause.\n“When I did find out that he was twenty-three when he got Joanne pregnant with me, I\nthought, whoa!”\nThe relationship between Jobs and Brennan quickly deteriorated. “Chrisann would\nget into this kind of victim mode, when she would say that Steve and I were ganging up\non her,” Kottke recalled. “Steve would just laugh and not take her seriously.” Brennan\nwas not, as even she later admitted, very emotionally stable. She began breaking plates\nand throwing things. She said that Jobs kept provoking her with his callousness: “He\nwas an enlightened being who was cruel.” Kottke was caught in the middle. “Daniel\ndidn’t have that DNA of ruthlessness, so he was a bit flipped by Steve’s behavior,”\naccording to Brennan. “He would go from ‘Steve’s not treating you right’ to laughing at\nme with Steve.”\nRobert Friedland came to her rescue. “He heard that I was pregnant, and he said to\ncome on up to the farm to have the baby,” she recalled. “So I did.” Elizabeth Holmes\nand other friends were still living there, and they found an Oregon midwife to help with\nthe delivery. On May 17, 1978, Brennan gave birth to a baby girl. Three days later Jobs\nflew up to be with them and help name the new baby. The practice on the commune was\nto give children Eastern spiritual names, but Jobs insisted that she had been born in\nAmerica and ought to have a name that fit. Brennan agreed. They named her Lisa Nicole\n\nBrennan, not giving her the last name Jobs. And then he left to go back to work at Apple.\n“He didn’t want to have anything to do with her or with me,” said Brennan.\nShe and Lisa moved to a tiny, dilapidated house in back of a home in Menlo Park.\nThey lived on welfare because Brennan did not feel up to suing for child support.\nFinally, the County of San Mateo sued Jobs to try to prove paternity and get him to take\nfinancial responsibility. At first Jobs was determined to fight the case. His lawyers\nwanted Kottke to testify that he had never seen them in bed together, and they tried to\nline up evidence that Brennan had been sleeping with other men. “At one point I yelled\nat Steve on the phone, ‘You know that is not true,’” Brennan recalled. “He was going to\ndrag me through court with a little baby and try to prove I was a whore and that anyone\ncould have been the father of that baby.”\nA year after Lisa was born, Jobs agreed to take a paternity test. Brennan’s family\nwas surprised, but Jobs knew that Apple would soon be going public and he decided it\nwas best to get the issue resolved. DNA tests were new, and the one that Jobs took was\ndone at UCLA. “I had read about DNA testing, and I was happy to do it to get things\nsettled,” he said. The results were pretty dispositive. “Probability of paternity ... is\n94.41%,” the report read. The California courts ordered Jobs to start paying $385 a\nmonth in child support, sign an agreement admitting paternity, and reimburse the county\n$5,856 in back welfare payments. He was given visitation rights but for a long time\ndidn’t exercise them.\nEven then Jobs continued at times to warp the reality around him. “He finally told us\non  the  board,”  Arthur  Rock  recalled,  “but  he  kept  insisting  that  there  was  a  large\nprobability that he wasn’t the father. He was delusional.” He told a reporter for Time,\nMichael Moritz, that when you analyzed the statistics, it was clear that “28% of the\nmale population in the United States could be the father.” It was not only a false claim\nbut  an  odd  one.  Worse  yet,  when  Chrisann  Brennan  later  heard  what  he  said,  she\nmistakenly thought that Jobs was hyperbolically claiming that she might have slept with\n28% of the men in the United States. “He was trying to paint me as a slut or a whore,”\nshe recalled. “He spun the whore image onto me in order to not take responsibility.”\nYears later Jobs was remorseful for the way he behaved, one of the few times in his\nlife he admitted as much:\nI wish I had handled it differently. I could not see myself as a father then, so I didn’t\nface up to it. But when the test results showed she was my daughter, it’s not true that I\ndoubted it. I agreed to support her until she was eighteen and give some money to\nChrisann as well. I found a house in Palo Alto and fixed it up and let them live there\nrent-free. Her mother found her great schools which I paid for. I tried to do the right\nthing. But if I could do it over, I would do a better job.\n\nOnce the case was resolved, Jobs began to move on with his life—maturing in some\nrespects, though not all. He put aside drugs, eased away from being a strict vegan, and\ncut back the time he spent on Zen retreats. He began getting stylish haircuts and buying\nsuits and shirts from the upscale San Francisco haberdashery Wilkes Bashford. And he\nsettled into a serious relationship with one of Regis McKenna’s employees, a beautiful\nPolynesian-Polish woman named Barbara Jasinski.\nThere was still, to be sure, a childlike rebellious streak in him. He, Jasinski, and\nKottke  liked  to  go  skinny-dipping  in  Felt  Lake  on  the  edge  of  Interstate  280  near\nStanford, and he bought a 1966 BMW R60/2 motorcycle that he adorned with orange\ntassels on the handlebars. He could also still be bratty. He belittled waitresses and\nfrequently returned food with the proclamation that it was “garbage.” At the company’s\nfirst Halloween party, in 1979, he dressed in robes as Jesus Christ, an act of semi-\nironic self-awareness that he considered funny but that caused a lot of eye rolling. Even\nhis initial stirrings of domesticity had some quirks. He bought a proper house in the Los\nGatos hills, which he adorned with a Maxfield Parrish painting, a Braun coffeemaker,\nand  Henckels  knives.  But  because  he  was  so  obsessive  when  it  came  to  selecting\nfurnishings, it remained mostly barren, lacking beds or chairs or couches. Instead his\nbedroom had a mattress in the center, framed pictures of Einstein and Maharaj-ji on the\nwalls, and an Apple II on the floor.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nXEROX AND LISA\nGraphical User Interfaces\nA New Baby\nThe Apple II took the company from Jobs’s garage to the pinnacle of a new industry. Its\nsales rose dramatically, from 2,500 units in 1977 to 210,000 in 1981. But Jobs was\nrestless. The Apple II could not remain successful forever, and he knew that, no matter\nhow much he had done to package it, from power cord to case, it would always be seen\nas Wozniak’s masterpiece. He needed his own machine. More than that, he wanted a\nproduct that would, in his words, make a dent in the universe.\nAt first he hoped that the Apple III would play that role. It would have more memory,\nthe screen would display eighty characters across rather than forty, and it would handle\nuppercase  and  lowercase  letters.  Indulging  his  passion  for  industrial  design,  Jobs\ndecreed the size and shape of the external case, and he refused to let anyone alter it,\neven as committees of engineers added more components to the circuit boards. The\nresult was piggybacked boards with poor connectors that frequently failed. When the\nApple  III  began  shipping  in  May  1980,  it  flopped.  Randy  Wigginton,  one  of  the\nengineers, summed it up: “The Apple III was kind of like a baby conceived during a\ngroup orgy, and later everybody had this bad headache, and there’s this bastard child,\nand everyone says, ‘It’s not mine.’”\nBy then Jobs had distanced himself from the Apple III and was thrashing about for\nways to produce something more radically different. At first he flirted with the idea of\ntouchscreens, but he found himself frustrated. At one demonstration of the technology, he\narrived late, fidgeted awhile, then abruptly cut off the engineers in the middle of their\npresentation with a brusque “Thank you.” They were confused. “Would you like us to\nleave?” one asked. Jobs said yes, then berated his colleagues for wasting his time.\n\nThen he and Apple hired two engineers from Hewlett-Packard to conceive a totally\nnew computer. The name Jobs chose for it would have caused even the most jaded\npsychiatrist  to  do  a  double  take:  the  Lisa.  Other  computers  had  been  named  after\ndaughters of their designers, but Lisa was a daughter Jobs had abandoned and had not\nyet  fully  admitted  was  his.  “Maybe  he  was  doing  it  out  of  guilt,”  said  Andrea\nCunningham, who worked at Regis McKenna on public relations for the project. “We\nhad to come up with an acronym so that we could claim it was not named after Lisa the\nchild.” The one they reverse-engineered was “local integrated systems architecture,”\nand despite being meaningless it became the official explanation for the name. Among\nthe engineers it was referred to as “Lisa: invented stupid acronym.” Years later, when I\nasked about the name, Jobs admitted simply, “Obviously it was named for my daughter.”\nThe Lisa was conceived as a $2,000 machine based on a sixteen-bit microprocessor,\nrather than the eight-bit one used in the Apple II. Without the wizardry of Wozniak, who\nwas  still  working  quietly  on  the  Apple  II,  the  engineers  began  producing  a\nstraightforward computer with a conventional text display, unable to push the powerful\nmicroprocessor  to  do  much  exciting  stuff.  Jobs  began  to  grow  impatient  with  how\nboring it was turning out to be.\nThere was, however, one programmer who was infusing the project with some life:\nBill Atkinson. He was a doctoral student in neuroscience who had experimented with\nhis fair share of acid. When he was asked to come work for Apple, he declined. But\nthen Apple sent him a non-refundable plane ticket, and he decided to use it and let Jobs\ntry to persuade him. “We are inventing the future,” Jobs told him at the end of a three-\nhour pitch. “Think about surfing on the front edge of a wave. It’s really exhilarating.\nNow think about dog-paddling at the tail end of that wave. It wouldn’t be anywhere near\nas much fun. Come down here and make a dent in the universe.” Atkinson did.\nWith his shaggy hair and droopy moustache that did not hide the animation in his\nface, Atkinson had some of Woz’s ingenuity along with Jobs’s passion for awesome\nproducts. His first job was to develop a program to track a stock portfolio by auto-\ndialing the Dow Jones service, getting quotes, then hanging up. “I had to create it fast\nbecause there was a magazine ad for the Apple II showing a hubby at the kitchen table\nlooking at an Apple screen filled with graphs of stock prices, and his wife is beaming at\nhim—but there wasn’t such a program, so I had to create one.” Next he created for the\nApple II a version of Pascal, a high-level programming language. Jobs had resisted,\nthinking that BASIC was all the Apple II needed, but he told Atkinson, “Since you’re so\npassionate  about  it,  I’ll  give  you  six  days  to  prove  me  wrong.”  He  did,  and  Jobs\nrespected him ever after.\nBy the fall of 1979 Apple was breeding three ponies to be potential successors to\nthe Apple II workhorse. There was the ill-fated Apple III. There was the Lisa project,\nwhich was beginning to disappoint Jobs. And somewhere off Jobs’s radar screen, at\nleast for the moment, there was a small skunkworks project for a low-cost machine that\nwas being developed by a colorful employee named Jef Raskin, a former professor who\n\nhad taught Bill Atkinson. Raskin’s goal was to make an inexpensive “computer for the\nmasses”  that  would  be  like  an  appliance—a  self-contained  unit  with  computer,\nkeyboard, monitor, and software all together—and have a graphical interface. He tried\nto turn his colleagues at Apple on to a cutting-edge research center, right in Palo Alto,\nthat was pioneering such ideas.\nXerox PARC\nThe Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC, had been\nestablished in 1970 to create a spawning ground for digital ideas. It was safely located,\nfor better and for worse, three thousand miles from the commercial pressures of Xerox\ncorporate headquarters in Connecticut. Among its visionaries was the scientist Alan\nKay, who had two great maxims that Jobs embraced: “The best way to predict the future\nis to invent it” and “People who are serious about software should make their own\nhardware.”  Kay  pushed  the  vision  of  a  small  personal  computer,  dubbed  the\n“Dynabook,”  that  would  be  easy  enough  for  children  to  use.  So  Xerox  PARC’s\nengineers began to develop user-friendly graphics that could replace all of the command\nlines and DOS prompts that made computer screens intimidating. The metaphor they\ncame up with was that of a desktop. The screen could have many documents and folders\non it, and you could use a mouse to point and click on the one you wanted to use.\nThis  graphical  user interface—or  GUI,  pronounced  “gooey”—was  facilitated  by\nanother concept pioneered at Xerox PARC: bitmapping. Until then, most computers\nwere character-based. You would type a character on a keyboard, and the computer\nwould  generate  that  character  on  the  screen,  usually  in  glowing  greenish  phosphor\nagainst a dark background. Since there were a limited number of letters, numerals, and\nsymbols, it didn’t take a whole lot of computer code or processing power to accomplish\nthis. In a bitmap system, on the other hand, each and every pixel on the screen is\ncontrolled by bits in the computer’s memory. To render something on the screen, such as\na letter, the computer has to tell each pixel to be light or dark or, in the case of color\ndisplays, what color to be. This uses a lot of computing power, but it permits gorgeous\ngraphics, fonts, and gee-whiz screen displays.\nBitmapping and graphical interfaces became features of Xerox PARC’s prototype\ncomputers, such as the Alto, and its object-oriented programming language, Smalltalk.\nJef Raskin decided that these features were the future of computing. So he began urging\nJobs and other Apple colleagues to go check out Xerox PARC.\nRaskin had one problem: Jobs regarded him as an insufferable theorist or, to use\nJobs’s own more precise terminology, “a shithead who sucks.” So Raskin enlisted his\nfriend Atkinson, who fell on the other side of Jobs’s shithead/genius division of the\nworld, to convince Jobs to take an interest in what was happening at Xerox PARC.\n\nWhat Raskin didn’t know was that Jobs was working on a more complex deal. Xerox’s\nventure capital division wanted to be part of the second round of Apple financing during\nthe summer of 1979. Jobs made an offer: “I will let you invest a million dollars in\nApple if you will open the kimono at PARC.” Xerox accepted. It agreed to show Apple\nits new technology and in return got to buy 100,000 shares at about $10 each.\nBy the time Apple went public a year later, Xerox’s $1 million worth of shares were\nworth  $17.6  million.  But  Apple  got  the  better  end  of  the  bargain.  Jobs  and  his\ncolleagues went to see Xerox PARC’s technology in December 1979 and, when Jobs\nrealized he hadn’t been shown enough, got an even fuller demonstration a few days\nlater. Larry Tesler was one of the Xerox scientists called upon to do the briefings, and\nhe was thrilled to show off the work that his bosses back east had never seemed to\nappreciate.  But  the  other  briefer,  Adele  Goldberg,  was  appalled  that  her  company\nseemed willing to give away its crown jewels. “It was incredibly stupid, completely\nnuts, and I fought to prevent giving Jobs much of anything,” she recalled.\nGoldberg got her way at the first briefing. Jobs, Raskin, and the Lisa team leader\nJohn Couch were ushered into the main lobby, where a Xerox Alto had been set up. “It\nwas a very controlled show of a few applications, primarily a word-processing one,”\nGoldberg said. Jobs wasn’t satisfied, and he called Xerox headquarters demanding\nmore.\nSo he was invited back a few days later, and this time he brought a larger team that\nincluded Bill Atkinson and Bruce Horn, an Apple programmer who had worked at\nXerox PARC. They both knew what to look for. “When I arrived at work, there was a\nlot of commotion, and I was told that Jobs and a bunch of his programmers were in the\nconference  room,”  said  Goldberg.  One  of  her  engineers  was  trying  to  keep  them\nentertained with more displays of the word-processing program. But Jobs was growing\nimpatient.  “Let’s  stop  this  bullshit!”  he  kept  shouting.  So  the  Xerox  folks  huddled\nprivately and decided to open the kimono a bit more, but only slowly. They agreed that\nTesler could show off Smalltalk, the programming language, but he would demonstrate\nonly what was known as the “unclassified” version. “It will dazzle [Jobs] and he’ll\nnever  know  he  didn’t  get  the  confidential  disclosure,”  the  head  of  the  team  told\nGoldberg.\nThey were wrong. Atkinson and others had read some of the papers published by\nXerox PARC, so they knew they were not getting a full description. Jobs phoned the\nhead of the Xerox venture capital division to complain; a call immediately came back\nfrom corporate headquarters in Connecticut decreeing that Jobs and his group should be\nshown everything. Goldberg stormed out in a rage.\nWhen Tesler finally showed them what was truly under the hood, the Apple folks\nwere astonished. Atkinson stared at the screen, examining each pixel so closely that\nTesler could feel the breath on his neck. Jobs bounced around and waved his arms\nexcitedly. “He was hopping around so much I don’t know how he actually saw most of\nthe demo, but he did, because he kept asking questions,” Tesler recalled. “He was the\n\nexclamation point for every step I showed.” Jobs kept saying that he couldn’t believe\nthat Xerox had not commercialized the technology. “You’re sitting on a gold mine,” he\nshouted. “I can’t believe Xerox is not taking advantage of this.”\nThe  Smalltalk  demonstration showed  three  amazing  features.  One  was  how\ncomputers  could  be  networked;  the  second  was  how  object-oriented  programming\nworked. But Jobs and his team paid little attention to these attributes because they were\nso amazed by the third feature, the graphical interface that was made possible by a\nbitmapped screen. “It was like a veil being lifted from my eyes,” Jobs recalled. “I could\nsee what the future of computing was destined to be.”\nWhen the Xerox PARC meeting ended after more than two hours, Jobs drove Bill\nAtkinson back to the Apple office in Cupertino. He was speeding, and so were his mind\nand mouth. “This is it!” he shouted, emphasizing each word. “We’ve got to do it!” It was\nthe breakthrough he had been looking for: bringing computers to the people, with the\ncheerful but affordable design of an Eichler home and the ease of use of a sleek kitchen\nappliance.\n“How long would this take to implement?” he asked.\n“I’m not sure,” Atkinson replied. “Maybe six months.” It was a wildly optimistic\nassessment, but also a motivating one.\n“Great Artists Steal”\nThe Apple raid on Xerox PARC is sometimes described as one of the biggest heists in\nthe chronicles of industry. Jobs occasionally endorsed this view, with pride. As he once\nsaid,  “Picasso  had  a  saying—‘good  artists  copy,  great  artists  steal’—and  we  have\nalways been shameless about stealing great ideas.”\nAnother assessment, also sometimes endorsed by Jobs, is that what transpired was\nless a heist by Apple than a fumble by Xerox. “They were copier-heads who had no\nclue about what a computer could do,” he said of Xerox’s management. “They just\ngrabbed defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry. Xerox could have\nowned the entire computer industry.”\nBoth assessments contain a lot of truth, but there is more to it than that. There falls a\nshadow, as T. S. Eliot noted, between the conception and the creation. In the annals of\ninnovation, new ideas are only part of the equation. Execution is just as important.\nJobs and his engineers significantly improved the graphical interface ideas they saw\nat Xerox PARC, and then were able to implement them in ways that Xerox never could\naccomplish. For example, the Xerox mouse had three buttons, was complicated, cost\n$300 apiece, and didn’t roll around smoothly; a few days after his second Xerox PARC\nvisit, Jobs went to a local industrial design firm, IDEO, and told one of its founders,\n\nDean Hovey, that he wanted a simple single-button model that cost $15, “and I want to\nbe able to use it on Formica and my blue jeans.” Hovey complied.\nThe improvements were in not just the details but the entire concept. The mouse at\nXerox PARC could not be used to drag a window around the screen. Apple’s engineers\ndevised an interface so you could not only drag windows and files around, you could\neven drop them into folders. The Xerox system required you to select a command in\norder to do anything, ranging from resizing a window to changing the extension that\nlocated a file. The Apple system transformed the desktop metaphor into virtual reality\nby allowing you to directly touch, manipulate, drag, and relocate things. And Apple’s\nengineers worked in tandem with its designers—with Jobs spurring them on daily—to\nimprove the desktop concept by adding delightful icons and menus that pulled down\nfrom a bar atop each window and the capability to open files and folders with a double\nclick.\nIt’s not as if Xerox executives ignored what their scientists had created at PARC. In\nfact they did try to capitalize on it, and in the process they showed why good execution\nis as important as good ideas. In 1981, well before the Apple Lisa or Macintosh, they\nintroduced the Xerox Star, a machine that featured their graphical user interface, mouse,\nbitmapped display, windows, and desktop metaphor. But it was clunky (it could take\nminutes to save a large file), costly ($16,595 at retail stores), and aimed mainly at the\nnetworked office market. It flopped; only thirty thousand were ever sold.\nJobs and his team went to a Xerox dealer to look at the Star as soon as it was\nreleased. But he deemed it so worthless that he told his colleagues they couldn’t spend\nthe money to buy one. “We were very relieved,” he recalled. “We knew they hadn’t\ndone it right, and that we could—at a fraction of the price.” A few weeks later he called\nBob Belleville, one of the hardware designers on the Xerox Star team. “Everything\nyou’ve ever done in your life is shit,” Jobs said, “so why don’t you come work for me?”\nBelleville did, and so did Larry Tesler.\nIn his excitement, Jobs began to take over the daily management of the Lisa project,\nwhich was being run by John Couch, the former HP engineer. Ignoring Couch, he dealt\ndirectly with Atkinson and Tesler to insert his own ideas, especially on Lisa’s graphical\ninterface design. “He would call me at all hours, 2 a.m. or 5 a.m.,” said Tesler. “I loved\nit. But it upset my bosses at the Lisa division.” Jobs was told to stop making out-of-\nchannel calls. He held himself back for a while, but not for long.\nOne important showdown occurred when Atkinson decided that the screen should\nhave a white background rather than a dark one. This would allow an attribute that both\nAtkinson  and  Jobs  wanted:  WYSIWYG,  pronounced  “wiz-ee-wig,”  an  acronym  for\n“What you see is what you get.” What you saw on the screen was what you’d get when\nyou printed it out. “The hardware team screamed bloody murder,” Atkinson recalled.\n“They said it would force us to use a phosphor that was a lot less persistent and would\nflicker more.” So Atkinson enlisted Jobs, who came down on his side. The hardware\nfolks grumbled, but then went off and figured it out. “Steve wasn’t much of an engineer\n\nhimself, but he was very good at assessing people’s answers. He could tell whether the\nengineers were defensive or unsure of themselves.”\nOne of Atkinson’s amazing feats (which we are so accustomed to nowadays that we\nrarely marvel at it) was to allow the windows on a screen to overlap so that the “top”\none clipped into the ones “below” it. Atkinson made it possible to move these windows\naround, just like shuffling papers on a desk, with those below becoming visible or\nhidden as you moved the top ones. Of course, on a computer screen there are no layers\nof pixels underneath the pixels that you see, so there are no windows actually lurking\nunderneath the ones that appear to be on top. To create the illusion of overlapping\nwindows requires complex coding that involves what are called “regions.” Atkinson\npushed himself to make this trick work because he thought he had seen this capability\nduring his visit to Xerox PARC. In fact the folks at PARC had never accomplished it,\nand they later told him they were amazed that he had done so. “I got a feeling for the\nempowering aspect of naïveté,” Atkinson said. “Because I didn’t know it couldn’t be\ndone, I was enabled to do it.” He was working so hard that one morning, in a daze, he\ndrove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed himself. Jobs immediately\ndrove to the hospital to see him. “We were pretty worried about you,” he said when\nAtkinson regained consciousness. Atkinson gave him a pained smile and replied, “Don’t\nworry, I still remember regions.”\nJobs also had a passion for smooth scrolling. Documents should not lurch line by\nline  as  you  scroll  through  them,  but  instead  should  flow.  “He  was  adamant  that\neverything on the interface had a good feeling to the user,” Atkinson said. They also\nwanted  a  mouse  that  could  easily  move  the  cursor  in  any  direction,  not  just  up-\ndown/left-right. This required using a ball rather than the usual two wheels. One of the\nengineers told Atkinson that there was no way to build such a mouse commercially.\nAfter Atkinson complained to Jobs over dinner, he arrived at the office the next day to\ndiscover that Jobs had fired the engineer. When his replacement met Atkinson, his first\nwords were, “I can build the mouse.”\nAtkinson and Jobs became best friends for a while, eating together at the Good Earth\nmost nights. But John Couch and the other professional engineers on his Lisa team, many\nof them buttoned-down HP types, resented Jobs’s meddling and were infuriated by his\nfrequent insults. There was also a clash of visions. Jobs wanted to build a VolksLisa, a\nsimple  and  inexpensive  product  for  the  masses.  “There  was  a  tug-of-war  between\npeople like me, who wanted a lean machine, and those from HP, like Couch, who were\naiming for the corporate market,” Jobs recalled.\nBoth Mike Scott and Mike Markkula were intent on bringing some order to Apple\nand became increasingly concerned about Jobs’s disruptive behavior. So in September\n1980, they secretly plotted a reorganization. Couch was made the undisputed manager of\nthe Lisa division. Jobs lost control of the computer he had named after his daughter. He\nwas also stripped of his role as vice president for research and development. He was\nmade  non-executive  chairman  of  the  board.  This  position  allowed  him  to  remain\n\nApple’s public face, but it meant that he had no operating control. That hurt. “I was\nupset and felt abandoned by Markkula,” he said. “He and Scotty felt I wasn’t up to\nrunning the Lisa division. I brooded about it a lot.”\n\nCHAPTER NINE\nGOING PUBLIC\nA Man of Wealth and Fame\nWith Wozniak, 1981\nOptions\nWhen Mike Markkula joined Jobs and Wozniak to turn their fledgling partnership into\nthe Apple Computer Co. in January 1977, they valued it at $5,309. Less than four years\nlater  they  decided  it  was  time  to  take  it  public.  It  would  become  the  most\noversubscribed initial public offering since that of Ford Motors in 1956. By the end of\n\nDecember 1980, Apple would be valued at $1.79 billion. Yes, billion. In the process it\nwould make three hundred people millionaires.\nDaniel Kottke was not one of them. He had been Jobs’s soul mate in college, in\nIndia, at the All One Farm, and in the rental house they shared during the Chrisann\nBrennan crisis. He joined Apple when it was headquartered in Jobs’s garage, and he\nstill worked there as an hourly employee. But he was not at a high enough level to be cut\nin on the stock options that were awarded before the IPO. “I totally trusted Steve, and I\nassumed he would take care of me like I’d taken care of him, so I didn’t push,” said\nKottke. The official reason he wasn’t given stock options was that he was an hourly\ntechnician, not a salaried engineer, which was the cutoff level for options. Even so, he\ncould have justifiably been given “founder’s stock,” but Jobs decided not to. “Steve is\nthe opposite of loyal,” according to Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple engineer who has\nnevertheless remained friends with him. “He’s anti-loyal. He has to abandon the people\nhe is close to.”\nKottke  decided  to  press  his  case  with  Jobs  by  hovering  outside  his  office  and\ncatching him to make a plea. But at each encounter, Jobs brushed him off. “What was\nreally so difficult for me is that Steve never told me I wasn’t eligible,” recalled Kottke.\n“He owed me that as a friend. When I would ask him about stock, he would tell me I\nhad to talk to my manager.” Finally, almost six months after the IPO, Kottke worked up\nthe courage to march into Jobs’s office and try to hash out the issue. But when he got in\nto see him, Jobs was so cold that Kottke froze. “I just got choked up and began to cry\nand just couldn’t talk to him,” Kottke recalled. “Our friendship was all gone. It was so\nsad.”\nRod Holt, the engineer who had built the power supply, was getting a lot of options,\nand he tried to turn Jobs around. “We have to do something for your buddy Daniel,” he\nsaid, and he suggested they each give him some of their own options. “Whatever you\ngive him, I will match it,” said Holt. Replied Jobs, “Okay. I will give him zero.”\nWozniak, not surprisingly, had the opposite attitude. Before the shares went public,\nhe decided to sell, at a very low price, two thousand of his options to each of forty\ndifferent midlevel employees. Most of his beneficiaries made enough to buy a home.\nWozniak bought a dream home for himself and his new wife, but she soon divorced him\nand kept the house. He also later gave shares outright to employees he felt had been\nshortchanged, including Kottke, Fernandez, Wigginton, and Espinosa. Everyone loved\nWozniak, all the more so after his generosity, but many also agreed with Jobs that he\nwas “awfully naïve and childlike.” A few months later a United Way poster showing a\ndestitute man went up on a company bulletin board. Someone scrawled on it “Woz in\n1990.”\nJobs was not naïve. He had made sure his deal with Chrisann Brennan was signed\nbefore the IPO occurred.\nJobs was the public face of the IPO, and he helped choose the two investment banks\nhandling  it:  the  traditional  Wall  Street  firm  Morgan  Stanley  and  the  untraditional\n\nboutique firm Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco. “Steve was very irreverent toward\nthe guys from Morgan Stanley, which was a pretty uptight firm in those days,” recalled\nBill Hambrecht. Morgan Stanley planned to price the offering at $18, even though it was\nobvious the shares would quickly shoot up. “Tell me what happens to this stock that we\npriced at eighteen?” Jobs asked the bankers. “Don’t you sell it to your good customers?\nIf so, how can you charge me a 7% commission?” Hambrecht recognized that there was\na basic unfairness in the system, and he later went on to formulate the idea of a reverse\nauction to price shares before an IPO.\nApple went public the morning of December 12, 1980. By then the bankers had\npriced the stock at $22 a share. It went to $29 the first day. Jobs had come into the\nHambrecht & Quist office just in time to watch the opening trades. At age twenty-five,\nhe was now worth $256 million.\nBaby You’re a Rich Man\nBefore and after he was rich, and indeed throughout a life that included being both\nbroke and a billionaire, Steve Jobs’s attitude toward wealth was complex. He was an\nantimaterialistic hippie who capitalized on the inventions of a friend who wanted to\ngive them away for free, and he was a Zen devotee who made a pilgrimage to India and\nthen decided that his calling was to create a business. And yet somehow these attitudes\nseemed to weave together rather than conflict.\nHe had a great love for some material objects, especially those that were finely\ndesigned and crafted, such as Porsche and Mercedes cars, Henckels knives and Braun\nappliances, BMW motorcycles and Ansel Adams prints, Bösendorfer pianos and Bang\n& Olufsen audio equipment. Yet the houses he lived in, no matter how rich he became,\ntended not to be ostentatious and were furnished so simply they would have put a\nShaker to shame. Neither then nor later would he travel with an entourage, keep a\npersonal staff, or even have security protection. He bought a nice car, but always drove\nhimself. When Markkula asked Jobs to join him in buying a Lear jet, he declined (though\nhe eventually would demand of Apple a Gulfstream to use). Like his father, he could be\nflinty when bargaining with suppliers, but he didn’t allow a craving for profits to take\nprecedence over his passion for building great products.\nThirty years after Apple went public, he reflected on what it was like to come into\nmoney suddenly:\nI never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I\nwould starve. And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew\nI could get by. I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a\n\npretty simple life even when I was working. So I went from fairly poor, which was\nwonderful, because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I\nalso didn’t have to worry about money.\nI watched people at Apple who made a lot of money and felt they had to live\ndifferently. Some of them bought a Rolls-Royce and various houses, each with a house\nmanager and then someone to manage the house managers. Their wives got plastic\nsurgery and turned into these bizarre people. This was not how I wanted to live. It’s\ncrazy. I made a promise to myself that I’m not going to let this money ruin my life.\nHe  was  not  particularly  philanthropic.  He  briefly  set  up  a  foundation,  but  he\ndiscovered that it was annoying to have to deal with the person he had hired to run it,\nwho  kept  talking  about  “venture”  philanthropy  and  how  to  “leverage”  giving.  Jobs\nbecame contemptuous of people who made a display of philanthropy or thinking they\ncould reinvent it. Earlier he had quietly sent in a $5,000 check to help launch Larry\nBrilliant’s Seva Foundation to fight diseases of poverty, and he even agreed to join the\nboard. But when Brilliant brought some board members, including Wavy Gravy and\nJerry  Garcia,  to  Apple  right  after  its  IPO  to  solicit  a  donation,  Jobs  was  not\nforthcoming. He instead worked on finding ways that a donated Apple II and a VisiCalc\nprogram could make it easier for the foundation to do a survey it was planning on\nblindness in Nepal.\nHis biggest personal gift was to his parents, Paul and Clara Jobs, to whom he gave\nabout $750,000 worth of stock. They sold some to pay off the mortgage on their Los\nAltos home, and their son came over for the little celebration. “It was the first time in\ntheir lives they didn’t have a mortgage,” Jobs recalled. “They had a handful of their\nfriends over for the party, and it was really nice.” Still, they didn’t consider buying a\nnicer house. “They weren’t interested in that,” Jobs said. “They had a life they were\nhappy with.” Their only splurge was to take a Princess cruise each year. The one\nthrough the Panama Canal “was the big one for my dad,” according to Jobs, because it\nreminded him of when his Coast Guard ship went through on its way to San Francisco to\nbe decommissioned.\nWith Apple’s success came fame for its poster boy. Inc. became the first magazine to\nput him on its cover, in October 1981. “This man has changed business forever,” it\nproclaimed. It showed Jobs with a neatly trimmed beard and well-styled long hair,\nwearing blue jeans and a dress shirt with a blazer that was a little too satiny. He was\nleaning on an Apple II and looking directly into the camera with the mesmerizing stare\nhe had picked up from Robert Friedland. “When Steve Jobs speaks, it is with the gee-\nwhiz enthusiasm of someone who sees the future and is making sure it works,” the\nmagazine reported.\nTime followed in February 1982 with a package on young entrepreneurs. The cover\nwas  a  painting  of  Jobs,  again  with  his  hypnotic  stare.  Jobs,  said  the  main  story,\n\n“practically singlehanded created the personal computer industry.” The accompanying\nprofile, written by Michael Moritz, noted, “At 26, Jobs heads a company that six years\nago was located in a bedroom and garage of his parents’ house, but this year it is\nexpected to have sales of $600 million.... As an executive, Jobs has sometimes been\npetulant and harsh on subordinates. Admits he: ‘I’ve got to learn to keep my feelings\nprivate.’”\nDespite  his  new  fame  and  fortune,  he  still  fancied  himself  a  child  of  the\ncounterculture. On a visit to a Stanford class, he took off his Wilkes Bashford blazer\nand his shoes, perched on top of a table, and crossed his legs into a lotus position. The\nstudents asked questions, such as when Apple’s stock price would rise, which Jobs\nbrushed  off.  Instead  he  spoke  of  his  passion  for  future  products,  such  as  someday\nmaking a computer as small as a book. When the business questions tapered off, Jobs\nturned the tables on the well-groomed students. “How many of you are virgins?” he\nasked. There were nervous giggles. “How many of you have taken LSD?” More nervous\nlaughter, and only one or two hands went up. Later Jobs would complain about the new\ngeneration of kids, who seemed to him more materialistic and careerist than his own.\n“When I went to school, it was right after the sixties and before this general wave of\npractical purposefulness had set in,” he said. “Now students aren’t even thinking in\nidealistic  terms,  or  at  least  nowhere  near  as  much.”  His  generation,  he  said,  was\ndifferent. “The idealistic wind of the sixties is still at our backs, though, and most of the\npeople I know who are my age have that ingrained in them forever.”\n\nCHAPTER TEN\nTHE MAC IS BORN\nYou Say You Want a Revolution\nJobs in 1982\nJef Raskin’s Baby\nJef Raskin was the type of character who could enthrall Steve Jobs—or annoy him. As\nit  turned  out,  he  did  both.  A  philosophical  guy  who  could  be  both  playful  and\nponderous,  Raskin  had  studied  computer  science,  taught  music  and  visual  arts,\nconducted a chamber opera company, and organized guerrilla theater. His 1967 doctoral\nthesis at U.C. San Diego argued that computers should have graphical rather than text-\nbased interfaces. When he got fed up with teaching, he rented a hot air balloon, flew\nover the chancellor’s house, and shouted down his decision to quit.\n\nWhen Jobs was looking for someone to write a manual for the Apple II in 1976, he\ncalled Raskin, who had his own little consulting firm. Raskin went to the garage, saw\nWozniak beavering away at a workbench, and was convinced by Jobs to write the\nmanual for $50. Eventually he became the manager of Apple’s publications department.\nOne of Raskin’s dreams was to build an inexpensive computer for the masses, and in\n1979 he convinced Mike Markkula to put him in charge of a small development project\ncode-named  “Annie”  to  do  just  that.  Since  Raskin  thought  it  was  sexist  to  name\ncomputers after women, he redubbed the project in honor of his favorite type of apple,\nthe McIntosh. But he changed the spelling in order not to conflict with the name of the\naudio equipment maker McIntosh Laboratory. The proposed computer became known as\nthe Macintosh.\nRaskin envisioned a machine that would sell for $1,000 and be a simple appliance,\nwith screen and keyboard and computer all in one unit. To keep the cost down, he\nproposed a tiny five-inch screen and a very cheap (and underpowered) microprocessor,\nthe Motorola 6809. Raskin fancied himself a philosopher, and he wrote his thoughts in\nan ever-expanding notebook that he called “The Book of Macintosh.” He also issued\noccasional manifestos. One of these was called “Computers by the Millions,” and it\nbegan with an aspiration: “If personal computers are to be truly personal, it will have to\nbe as likely as not that a family, picked at random, will own one.”\nThroughout 1979 and early 1980 the Macintosh project led a tenuous existence.\nEvery few months it would almost get killed off, but each time Raskin managed to\ncajole Markkula into granting clemency. It had a research team of only four engineers\nlocated in the original Apple office space next to the Good Earth restaurant, a few\nblocks from the company’s new main building. The work space was filled with enough\ntoys and radio-controlled model airplanes (Raskin’s passion) to make it look like a day\ncare center for geeks. Every now and then work would cease for a loosely organized\ngame of Nerf ball tag. Andy Hertzfeld recalled, “This inspired everyone to surround\ntheir work area with barricades made out of cardboard, to provide cover during the\ngame, making part of the office look like a cardboard maze.”\nThe star of the team was a blond, cherubic, and psychologically intense self-taught\nyoung engineer named Burrell Smith, who worshipped the code work of Wozniak and\ntried to pull off similar dazzling feats. Atkinson discovered Smith working in Apple’s\nservice department and, amazed at his ability to improvise fixes, recommended him to\nRaskin. Smith would later succumb to schizophrenia, but in the early 1980s he was able\nto channel his manic intensity into weeklong binges of engineering brilliance.\nJobs  was  enthralled  by  Raskin’s  vision,  but  not  by  his  willingness  to  make\ncompromises to keep down the cost. At one point in the fall of 1979 Jobs told him\ninstead to focus on building what he repeatedly called an “insanely great” product.\n“Don’t worry about price, just specify the computer’s abilities,” Jobs told him. Raskin\nresponded with a sarcastic memo. It spelled out everything you would want in the\nproposed computer: a high-resolution color display, a printer that worked without a\n\nribbon and could produce graphics in color at a page per second, unlimited access to\nthe  ARPA  net,  and  the  capability  to  recognize  speech  and  synthesize  music,  “even\nsimulate  Caruso  singing  with  the  Mormon  tabernacle  choir,  with  variable\nreverberation.” The memo concluded, “Starting with the abilities desired is nonsense.\nWe must start both with a price goal, and a set of abilities, and keep an eye on today’s\nand the immediate future’s technology.” In other words, Raskin had little patience for\nJobs’s belief that you could distort reality if you had enough passion for your product.\nThus they were destined to clash, especially after Jobs was ejected from the Lisa\nproject in September 1980 and began casting around for someplace else to make his\nmark. It was inevitable that his gaze would fall on the Macintosh project. Raskin’s\nmanifestos  about  an  inexpensive  machine  for  the  masses,  with  a  simple  graphic\ninterface and clean design, stirred his soul. And it was also inevitable that once Jobs set\nhis sights on the Macintosh project, Raskin’s days were numbered. “Steve started acting\non what he thought we should do, Jef started brooding, and it instantly was clear what\nthe outcome would be,” recalled Joanna Hoffman, a member of the Mac team.\nThe first conflict was over Raskin’s devotion to the underpowered Motorola 6809\nmicroprocessor. Once again it was a clash between Raskin’s desire to keep the Mac’s\nprice under $1,000 and Jobs’s determination to build an insanely great machine. So\nJobs began pushing for the Mac to switch to the more powerful Motorola 68000, which\nis what the Lisa was using. Just before Christmas 1980, he challenged Burrell Smith,\nwithout telling Raskin, to make a redesigned prototype that used the more powerful\nchip. As his hero Wozniak would have done, Smith threw himself into the task around\nthe clock, working nonstop for three weeks and employing all sorts of breathtaking\ncircuit-design leaps. When he succeeded, Jobs was able to force the switch to the\nMotorola 68000, and Raskin had to brood and recalculate the cost of the Mac.\nThere  was  something  larger  at  stake.  The  cheaper  microprocessor  that  Raskin\nwanted  would  not  have  been  able  to  accommodate  all  of  the  gee-whiz  graphics—\nwindows, menus, mouse, and so on—that the team had seen on the Xerox PARC visits.\nRaskin  had  convinced  everyone  to  go  to  Xerox  PARC,  and  he  liked  the  idea  of  a\nbitmapped display and windows, but he was not as charmed by all the cute graphics and\nicons, and he absolutely detested the idea of using a point-and-click mouse rather than\nthe keyboard. “Some of the people on the project became enamored of the quest to do\neverything  with  the  mouse,”  he  later  groused.  “Another  example  is  the  absurd\napplication  of  icons.  An  icon  is  a  symbol  equally  incomprehensible  in  all  human\nlanguages. There’s a reason why humans invented phonetic languages.”\nRaskin’s former student Bill Atkinson sided with Jobs. They both wanted a powerful\nprocessor that could support whizzier graphics and the use of a mouse. “Steve had to\ntake the project away from Jef,” Atkinson said. “Jef was pretty firm and stubborn, and\nSteve was right to take it over. The world got a better result.”\nThe  disagreements  were  more  than  just  philosophical;  they  became  clashes  of\npersonality. “I think that he likes people to jump when he says jump,” Raskin once said.\n\n“I felt that he was untrustworthy, and that he does not take kindly to being found wanting.\nHe  doesn’t  seem  to  like  people  who  see  him  without  a  halo.”  Jobs  was  equally\ndismissive of Raskin. “Jef was really pompous,” he said. “He didn’t know much about\ninterfaces. So I decided to nab some of his people who were really good, like Atkinson,\nbring in some of my own, take the thing over and build a less expensive Lisa, not some\npiece of junk.”\nSome on the team found Jobs impossible to work with. “Jobs seems to introduce\ntension, politics, and hassles rather than enjoying a buffer from those distractions,” one\nengineer wrote in a memo to Raskin in December 1980. “I thoroughly enjoy talking with\nhim, and I admire his ideas, practical perspective, and energy. But I just don’t feel that\nhe provides the trusting, supportive, relaxed environment that I need.”\nBut  many  others  realized  that  despite  his  temperamental  failings,  Jobs  had  the\ncharisma and corporate clout that would lead them to “make a dent in the universe.”\nJobs told the staff that Raskin was just a dreamer, whereas he was a doer and would get\nthe Mac done in a year. It was clear he wanted vindication for having been ousted from\nthe Lisa group, and he was energized by competition. He publicly bet John Couch\n$5,000  that  the  Mac  would  ship  before  the  Lisa.  “We  can  make  a  computer  that’s\ncheaper and better than the Lisa, and get it out first,” he told the team.\nJobs asserted his control of the group by canceling a brown-bag lunch seminar that\nRaskin  was  scheduled  to  give  to  the  whole  company  in  February  1981.  Raskin\nhappened to go by the room anyway and discovered that there were a hundred people\nthere  waiting  to  hear  him;  Jobs  had  not  bothered  to  notify  anyone  else  about  his\ncancellation order. So Raskin went ahead and gave a talk.\nThat incident led Raskin to write a blistering memo to Mike Scott, who once again\nfound himself in the difficult position of being a president trying to manage a company’s\ntemperamental cofounder and major stockholder. It was titled “Working for/with Steve\nJobs,” and in it Raskin asserted:\nHe is a dreadful manager. ... I have always liked Steve, but I have found it impossible\nto work for him. ... Jobs regularly misses appointments. This is so well-known as to be\nalmost a running joke. ... He acts without thinking and with bad judgment. ... He does\nnot give credit where due. ... Very often, when told of a new idea, he will immediately\nattack it and say that it is worthless or even stupid, and tell you that it was a waste of\ntime to work on it. This alone is bad management, but if the idea is a good one he will\nsoon be telling people about it as though it was his own.\nThat afternoon Scott called in Jobs and Raskin for a showdown in front of Markkula.\nJobs started crying. He and Raskin agreed on only one thing: Neither could work for the\nother one. On the Lisa project, Scott had sided with Couch. This time he decided it was\n\nbest to let Jobs win. After all, the Mac was a minor development project housed in a\ndistant building that could keep Jobs occupied away from the main campus. Raskin was\ntold to take a leave of absence. “They wanted to humor me and give me something to do,\nwhich was fine,” Jobs recalled. “It was like going back to the garage for me. I had my\nown ragtag team and I was in control.”\nRaskin’s ouster  may  not  have  seemed  fair,  but  it  ended  up  being  good  for  the\nMacintosh. Raskin wanted an appliance with little memory, an anemic processor, a\ncassette tape, no mouse, and minimal graphics. Unlike Jobs, he might have been able to\nkeep the price down to close to $1,000, and that may have helped Apple win market\nshare. But he could not have pulled off what Jobs did, which was to create and market a\nmachine that would transform personal computing. In fact we can see where the road not\ntaken led. Raskin was hired by Canon to build the machine he wanted. “It was the\nCanon Cat, and it was a total flop,” Atkinson said. “Nobody wanted it. When Steve\nturned the Mac into a compact version of the Lisa, it made it into a computing platform\ninstead of a consumer electronic device.”\n*\nTexaco Towers\nA few days after Raskin left, Jobs appeared at the cubicle of Andy Hertzfeld, a young\nengineer on the Apple II team, who had a cherubic face and impish demeanor similar to\nhis pal Burrell Smith’s. Hertzfeld recalled that most of his colleagues were afraid of\nJobs “because of his spontaneous temper tantrums and his proclivity to tell everyone\nexactly what he thought, which often wasn’t very favorable.” But Hertzfeld was excited\nby him. “Are you any good?” Jobs asked the moment he walked in. “We only want\nreally  good  people  working  on  the  Mac,  and  I’m  not  sure  you’re  good  enough.”\nHertzfeld knew how to answer. “I told him that yes, I thought that I was pretty good.”\nJobs left, and Hertzfeld went back to his work. Later that afternoon he looked up to\nsee Jobs peering over the wall of his cubicle. “I’ve got good news for you,” he said.\n“You’re working on the Mac team now. Come with me.”\nHertzfeld replied that he needed a couple more days to finish the Apple II product he\nwas in the middle of. “What’s more important than working on the Macintosh?” Jobs\ndemanded. Hertzfeld explained that he needed to get his Apple II DOS program in good\nenough shape to hand it over to someone. “You’re just wasting your time with that!”\nJobs replied. “Who cares about the Apple II? The Apple II will be dead in a few years.\nThe Macintosh is the future of Apple, and you’re going to start on it now!” With that,\nJobs  yanked  out  the  power  cord  to  Hertzfeld’s  Apple  II,  causing  the  code  he  was\nworking on to vanish. “Come with me,” Jobs said. “I’m going to take you to your new\ndesk.” Jobs drove Hertzfeld, computer and all, in his silver Mercedes to the Macintosh\noffices. “Here’s your new desk,” he said, plopping him in a space next to Burrell Smith.\n\n“Welcome to the Mac team!” The desk had been Raskin’s. In fact Raskin had left so\nhastily that some of the drawers were still filled with his flotsam and jetsam, including\nmodel airplanes.\nJobs’s primary test for recruiting people in the spring of 1981 to be part of his merry\nband  of  pirates  was  making  sure  they  had  a  passion  for  the  product.  He  would\nsometimes bring candidates into a room where a prototype of the Mac was covered by a\ncloth, dramatically unveil it, and watch. “If their eyes lit up, if they went right for the\nmouse and started pointing and clicking, Steve would smile and hire them,” recalled\nAndrea Cunningham. “He wanted them to say ‘Wow!’”\nBruce Horn was one of the programmers at Xerox PARC. When some of his friends,\nsuch as Larry Tesler, decided to join the Macintosh group, Horn considered going there\nas well. But he got a good offer, and a $15,000 signing bonus, to join another company.\nJobs called him on a Friday night. “You have to come into Apple tomorrow morning,”\nhe said. “I have a lot of stuff to show you.” Horn did, and Jobs hooked him. “Steve was\nso passionate about building this amazing device that would change the world,” Horn\nrecalled. “By sheer force of his personality, he changed my mind.” Jobs showed Horn\nexactly how the plastic would be molded and would fit together at perfect angles, and\nhow good the board was going to look inside. “He wanted me to see that this whole\nthing was going to happen and it was thought out from end to end. Wow, I said, I don’t\nsee that kind of passion every day. So I signed up.”\nJobs even tried to reengage Wozniak. “I resented the fact that he had not been doing\nmuch, but then I thought, hell, I wouldn’t be here without his brilliance,” Jobs later told\nme. But as soon as Jobs was starting to get him interested in the Mac, Wozniak crashed\nhis new single-engine Beechcraft while attempting a takeoff near Santa Cruz. He barely\nsurvived and ended up with partial amnesia. Jobs spent time at the hospital, but when\nWozniak recovered he decided it was time to take a break from Apple. Ten years after\ndropping out of Berkeley, he decided to return there to finally get his degree, enrolling\nunder the name of Rocky Raccoon Clark.\nIn order to make the project his own, Jobs decided it should no longer be code-\nnamed after Raskin’s favorite apple. In various interviews, Jobs had been referring to\ncomputers as a bicycle for the mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed\nthem to move more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create\ncomputers would multiply the efficiency of their minds. So one day Jobs decreed that\nhenceforth the Macintosh should be known instead as the Bicycle. This did not go over\nwell. “Burrell and I thought this was the silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply\nrefused to use the new name,” recalled Hertzfeld. Within a month the idea was dropped.\nBy early 1981 the Mac team had grown to about twenty, and Jobs decided that they\nshould have bigger quarters. So he moved everyone to the second floor of a brown-\nshingled, two-story building about three blocks from Apple’s main offices. It was next\nto a Texaco station and thus became known as Texaco Towers. In order to make the\noffice more lively, he told the team to buy a stereo system. “Burrell and I ran out and\n\nbought a silver, cassette-based boom box right away, before he could change his mind,”\nrecalled Hertzfeld.\nJobs’s triumph was soon complete. A few weeks after winning his power struggle\nwith  Raskin  to  run  the  Mac  division,  he  helped  push  out  Mike  Scott  as  Apple’s\npresident. Scotty had become more and more erratic, alternately bullying and nurturing.\nHe finally lost most of his support among the employees when he surprised them by\nimposing a round of layoffs that he handled with atypical ruthlessness. In addition, he\nhad begun to suffer a variety of afflictions, ranging from eye infections to narcolepsy.\nWhen Scott was on vacation in Hawaii, Markkula called together the top managers to\nask if he should be replaced. Most of them, including Jobs and John Couch, said yes. So\nMarkkula took over as an interim and rather passive president, and Jobs found that he\nnow had full rein to do what he wanted with the Mac division.\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\nTHE REALITY DISTORTION FIELD\nPlaying by His Own Set of Rules\nThe original Mac team in 1984: George Crow, Joanna Hoffman, Burrell Smith, Andy\nHertzfeld, Bill Atkinson, and Jerry Manock\nWhen Andy Hertzfeld joined the Macintosh team, he got a briefing from Bud Tribble,\nthe other software designer, about the huge amount of work that still needed to be done.\nJobs  wanted  it  finished  by  January  1982,  less  than  a  year  away.  “That’s  crazy,”\nHertzfeld said. “There’s no way.” Tribble said that Jobs would not accept any contrary\nfacts.  “The  best  way  to  describe  the  situation  is  a  term  from Star  Trek,”  Tribble\nexplained.  “Steve  has  a  reality  distortion  field.”  When  Hertzfeld  looked  puzzled,\nTribble elaborated. “In his presence, reality is malleable. He can convince anyone of\npractically anything. It wears off when he’s not around, but it makes it hard to have\nrealistic schedules.”\nTribble recalled that he adopted the phrase from the “Menagerie” episodes of Star\nTrek, “in which the aliens create their own new world through sheer mental force.” He\nmeant the phrase to be a compliment as well as a caution: “It was dangerous to get\n\ncaught in Steve’s distortion field, but it was what led him to actually be able to change\nreality.”\nAt first Hertzfeld thought that Tribble was exaggerating, but after two weeks of\nworking  with  Jobs,  he  became  a  keen  observer  of  the  phenomenon.  “The  reality\ndistortion  field  was  a  confounding  mélange  of  a  charismatic  rhetorical  style,\nindomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand,” he said.\nThere  was  little  that  could  shield  you  from  the  force,  Hertzfeld  discovered.\n“Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely\naware of it. We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it, but after a\nwhile most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of nature.” After Jobs decreed that the\nsodas  in  the  office  refrigerator  be  replaced  by  Odwalla  organic  orange  and  carrot\njuices, someone on the team had T-shirts made. “Reality Distortion Field,” they said on\nthe front, and on the back, “It’s in the juice!”\nTo some people, calling it a reality distortion field was just a clever way to say that\nJobs tended to lie. But it was in fact a more complex form of dissembling. He would\nassert something—be it a fact about world history or a recounting of who suggested an\nidea at a meeting—without even considering the truth. It came from willfully defying\nreality, not only to others but to himself. “He can deceive himself,” said Bill Atkinson.\n“It allowed him to con people into believing his vision, because he has personally\nembraced and internalized it.”\nA lot of people distort reality, of course. When Jobs did so, it was often a tactic for\naccomplishing  something.  Wozniak,  who  was  as  congenitally  honest  as  Jobs  was\ntactical, marveled at how effective it could be. “His reality distortion is when he has an\nillogical vision of the future, such as telling me that I could design the Breakout game in\njust a few days. You realize that it can’t be true, but he somehow makes it true.”\nWhen members of the Mac team got ensnared in his reality distortion field, they\nwere almost hypnotized. “He reminded me of Rasputin,” said Debi Coleman. “He laser-\nbeamed in on you and didn’t blink. It didn’t matter if he was serving purple Kool-Aid.\nYou  drank  it.”  But  like  Wozniak,  she  believed  that  the  reality  distortion  field  was\nempowering: It enabled Jobs to inspire his team to change the course of computer\nhistory  with  a fraction  of  the  resources  of  Xerox  or  IBM.  “It  was  a  self-fulfilling\ndistortion,” she claimed. “You did the impossible, because you didn’t realize it was\nimpossible.”\nAt the root of the reality distortion was Jobs’s belief that the rules didn’t apply to\nhim. He had some evidence for this; in his childhood, he had often been able to bend\nreality to his desires. Rebelliousness and willfulness were ingrained in his character.\nHe had the sense that he was special, a chosen one, an enlightened one. “He thinks there\nare a few people who are special—people like Einstein and Gandhi and the gurus he\nmet in India—and he’s one of them,” said Hertzfeld. “He told Chrisann this. Once he\neven hinted to me that he was enlightened. It’s almost like Nietzsche.” Jobs never\nstudied Nietzsche, but the philosopher’s concept of the will to power and the special\n\nnature  of  the Überman  came  naturally  to  him.  As  Nietzsche  wrote  in Thus  Spoke\nZarathustra, “The spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world\nnow conquers the world.” If reality did not comport with his will, he would ignore it, as\nhe  had  done  with  the  birth  of  his  daughter  and  would  do  years  later,  when  first\ndiagnosed with cancer. Even in small everyday rebellions, such as not putting a license\nplate on his car and parking it in handicapped spaces, he acted as if he were not subject\nto the strictures around him.\nAnother key aspect of Jobs’s worldview was his binary way of categorizing things.\nPeople were either “enlightened” or “an asshole.” Their work was either “the best” or\n“totally shitty.” Bill Atkinson, the Mac designer who fell on the good side of these\ndichotomies, described what it was like:\nIt was difficult working under Steve, because there was a great polarity between gods\nand shitheads. If you were a god, you were up on a pedestal and could do no wrong.\nThose of us who were considered to be gods, as I was, knew that we were actually\nmortal and made bad engineering decisions and farted like any person, so we were\nalways  afraid  that  we  would  get  knocked  off  our  pedestal.  The  ones  who  were\nshitheads, who were brilliant engineers working very hard, felt there was no way they\ncould get appreciated and rise above their status.\nBut these categories were not immutable, for Jobs could rapidly reverse himself.\nWhen briefing Hertzfeld about the reality distortion field, Tribble specifically warned\nhim about Jobs’s tendency to resemble high-voltage alternating current. “Just because he\ntells you that something is awful or great, it doesn’t necessarily mean he’ll feel that way\ntomorrow,” Tribble explained. “If you tell him a new idea, he’ll usually tell you that he\nthinks it’s stupid. But then, if he actually likes it, exactly one week later, he’ll come\nback to you and propose your idea to you, as if he thought of it.”\nThe audacity of this pirouette technique would have dazzled Diaghilev. “If one line\nof argument failed to persuade, he would deftly switch to another,” Hertzfeld said.\n“Sometimes, he would throw you off balance by suddenly adopting your position as his\nown, without acknowledging that he ever thought differently.” That happened repeatedly\nto Bruce Horn, the programmer who, with Tesler, had been lured from Xerox PARC.\n“One week I’d tell him about an idea that I had, and he would say it was crazy,”\nrecalled Horn. “The next week, he’d come and say, ‘Hey I have this great idea’—and it\nwould be my idea! You’d call him on it and say, ‘Steve, I told you that a week ago,’ and\nhe’d say, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah’ and just move right along.”\nIt was as if Jobs’s brain circuits were missing a device that would modulate the\nextreme spikes of impulsive opinions that popped into his mind. So in dealing with him,\nthe Mac team adopted an audio concept called a “low pass filter.” In processing his\n\ninput, they learned to reduce the amplitude of his high-frequency signals. That served to\nsmooth  out  the  data  set  and  provide  a  less  jittery  moving  average  of  his  evolving\nattitudes.  “After  a  few  cycles  of  him  taking  alternating  extreme  positions,”  said\nHertzfeld, “we would learn to low pass filter his signals and not react to the extremes.”\nWas  Jobs’s  unfiltered  behavior  caused  by  a  lack  of  emotional  sensitivity?  No.\nAlmost the opposite. He was very emotionally attuned, able to read people and know\ntheir psychological strengths and vulnerabilities. He could stun an unsuspecting victim\nwith an emotional towel-snap, perfectly aimed. He intuitively knew when someone was\nfaking  it  or  truly  knew  something.  This  made  him  masterful  at  cajoling,  stroking,\npersuading, flattering, and intimidating people. “He had the uncanny capacity to know\nexactly what your weak point is, know what will make you feel small, to make you\ncringe,” Joanna Hoffman said. “It’s a common trait in people who are charismatic and\nknow  how  to  manipulate  people.  Knowing  that  he  can  crush  you  makes  you  feel\nweakened and eager for his approval, so then he can elevate you and put you on a\npedestal and own you.”\nAnn Bowers became an expert at dealing with Jobs’s perfectionism, petulance, and\nprickliness. She had been the human resources director at Intel, but had stepped aside\nafter she married its cofounder Bob Noyce. She joined Apple in 1980 and served as a\ncalming mother figure who would step in after one of Jobs’s tantrums. She would go to\nhis office, shut the door, and gently lecture him. “I know, I know,” he would say. “Well,\nthen, please stop doing it,” she would insist. Bowers recalled, “He would be good for a\nwhile, and then a week or so later I would get a call again.” She realized that he could\nbarely contain himself. “He had these huge expectations, and if people didn’t deliver, he\ncouldn’t stand it. He couldn’t control himself. I could understand why Steve would get\nupset, and he was usually right, but it had a hurtful effect. It created a fear factor. He\nwas self-aware, but that didn’t always modify his behavior.”\nJobs became close to Bowers and her husband, and he would drop in at their Los\nGatos Hills home unannounced. She would hear his motorcycle in the distance and say,\n“I guess we have Steve for dinner again.” For a while she and Noyce were like a\nsurrogate family. “He was so bright and also so needy. He needed a grown-up, a father\nfigure, which Bob became, and I became like a mother figure.”\nThere were some upsides to Jobs’s demanding and wounding behavior. People who\nwere not crushed ended up being stronger. They did better work, out of both fear and an\neagerness to please. “His behavior can be emotionally draining, but if you survive, it\nworks,” Hoffman said. You could also push back—sometimes—and not only survive\nbut thrive. That didn’t always work; Raskin tried it, succeeded for a while, and then\nwas destroyed. But if you were calmly confident, if Jobs sized you up and decided that\nyou knew what you were doing, he would respect you. In both his personal and his\nprofessional life over the years, his inner circle tended to include many more strong\npeople than toadies.\n\nThe Mac team knew that. Every year, beginning in 1981, it gave out an award to the\nperson who did the best job of standing up to him. The award was partly a joke, but\nalso partly real, and Jobs knew about it and liked it. Joanna Hoffman won the first year.\nFrom an Eastern European refugee family, she had a strong temper and will. One day,\nfor example, she discovered that Jobs had changed her marketing projections in a way\nshe found totally reality-distorting. Furious, she marched to his office. “As I’m climbing\nthe stairs, I told his assistant I am going to take a knife and stab it into his heart,” she\nrecounted. Al Eisenstat, the corporate counsel, came running out to restrain her. “But\nSteve heard me out and backed down.”\nHoffman  won  the  award  again  in  1982.  “I  remember  being  envious  of  Joanna,\nbecause  she  would  stand  up  to  Steve  and  I  didn’t  have  the  nerve  yet,”  said  Debi\nColeman, who joined the Mac team that year. “Then, in 1983, I got the award. I had\nlearned you had to stand up for what you believe, which Steve respected. I started\ngetting  promoted  by  him  after  that.”  Eventually  she  rose  to  become  head  of\nmanufacturing.\nOne day Jobs barged into the cubicle of one of Atkinson’s engineers and uttered his\nusual “This is shit.” As Atkinson recalled, “The guy said, ‘No it’s not, it’s actually the\nbest  way,’  and  he  explained  to  Steve  the  engineering  trade-offs  he’d  made.”  Jobs\nbacked down. Atkinson taught his team to put Jobs’s words through a translator. “We\nlearned to interpret ‘This is shit’ to actually be a question that means, ‘Tell me why this\nis  the  best  way  to  do  it.’”  But  the  story  had  a  coda,  which  Atkinson  also  found\ninstructive. Eventually the engineer found an even better way to perform the function\nthat Jobs had criticized. “He did it better because Steve had challenged him,” said\nAtkinson, “which shows you can push back on him but should also listen, for he’s\nusually right.”\nJobs’s prickly behavior was partly driven by his perfectionism and his impatience\nwith those who made compromises in order to get a product out on time and on budget.\n“He could not make trade-offs well,” said Atkinson. “If someone didn’t care to make\ntheir product perfect, they were a bozo.” At the West Coast Computer Faire in April\n1981, for example, Adam Osborne released the first truly portable personal computer. It\nwas not great—it had a five-inch screen and not much memory—but it worked well\nenough.  As  Osborne  famously  declared,  “Adequacy  is  sufficient.  All  else  is\nsuperfluous.”  Jobs  found  that  approach  to  be  morally  appalling,  and  he  spent  days\nmaking fun of Osborne. “This guy just doesn’t get it,” Jobs repeatedly railed as he\nwandered the Apple corridors. “He’s not making art, he’s making shit.”\nOne day Jobs came into the cubicle of Larry Kenyon, an engineer who was working\non the Macintosh operating system, and complained that it was taking too long to boot\nup. Kenyon started to explain, but Jobs cut him off. “If it could save a person’s life,\nwould you find a way to shave ten seconds off the boot time?” he asked. Kenyon\nallowed that he probably could. Jobs went to a whiteboard and showed that if there\nwere five million people using the Mac, and it took ten seconds extra to turn it on every\n\nday, that added up to three hundred million or so hours per year that people would save,\nwhich was the equivalent of at least one hundred lifetimes saved per year. “Larry was\nsuitably impressed, and a few weeks later he came back and it booted up twenty-eight\nseconds faster,” Atkinson recalled. “Steve had a way of motivating by looking at the\nbigger picture.”\nThe result was that the Macintosh team came to share Jobs’s passion for making a\ngreat product, not just a profitable one. “Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and he\nencouraged the design team to think of ourselves that way too,” said Hertzfeld. “The\ngoal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the\ngreatest thing possible, or even a little greater.” He once took the team to see an exhibit\nof Tiffany glass in San Francisco because he believed they could learn from Louis\nTiffany’s example of creating great art that could be mass-produced. Recalled Bud\nTribble, “We said to ourselves, ‘Hey, if we’re going to make things in our lives, we\nmight as well make them beautiful.’”\nWas all of his stormy and abusive behavior necessary? Probably not, nor was it\njustified. There were other ways to have motivated his team. Even though the Macintosh\nwould turn out to be great, it was way behind schedule and way over budget because of\nJobs’s impetuous interventions. There was also a cost in brutalized human feelings,\nwhich caused much of the team to burn out. “Steve’s contributions could have been\nmade without so many stories about him terrorizing folks,” Wozniak said. “I like being\nmore patient and not having so many conflicts. I think a company can be a good family.\nIf the Macintosh project had been run my way, things probably would have been a mess.\nBut I think if it had been a mix of both our styles, it would have been better than just the\nway Steve did it.”\nBut even though Jobs’s style could be demoralizing, it could also be oddly inspiring.\nIt infused Apple employees with an abiding passion to create groundbreaking products\nand a belief that they could accomplish what seemed impossible. They had T-shirts\nmade that read “90 hours a week and loving it!” Out of a fear of Jobs mixed with an\nincredibly strong urge to impress him, they exceeded their own expectations. “I’ve\nlearned over the years that when you have really good people you don’t have to baby\nthem,” Jobs later explained. “By expecting them to do great things, you can get them to\ndo great things. The original Mac team taught me that A-plus players like to work\ntogether, and they don’t like it if you tolerate B work. Ask any member of that Mac team.\nThey will tell you it was worth the pain.”\nMost of them agree. “He would shout at a meeting, ‘You asshole, you never do\nanything  right,’”  Debi  Coleman  recalled.  “It  was  like  an  hourly  occurrence.  Yet  I\nconsider myself the absolute luckiest person in the world to have worked with him.”\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nTHE DESIGN\nReal Artists Simplify\nA Bauhaus Aesthetic\nUnlike most kids who grew up in Eichler homes, Jobs knew what they were and why\nthey were so wonderful. He liked the notion of simple and clean modernism produced\nfor the masses. He also loved listening to his father describe the styling intricacies of\nvarious cars. So from the beginning at Apple, he believed that great industrial design—\na colorfully simple logo, a sleek case for the Apple II—would set the company apart\nand make its products distinctive.\nThe company’s first office, after it moved out of his family garage, was in a small\nbuilding it shared with a Sony sales office. Sony was famous for its signature style and\nmemorable product designs, so Jobs would drop by to study the marketing material. “He\nwould come in looking scruffy and fondle the product brochures and point out design\nfeatures,” said Dan’l Lewin, who worked there. “Every now and then, he would ask,\n‘Can I take this brochure?’” By 1980, he had hired Lewin.\nHis fondness for the dark, industrial look of Sony receded around June 1981, when\nhe began attending the annual International Design Conference in Aspen. The meeting\nthat year focused on Italian style, and it featured the architect-designer Mario Bellini,\nthe  filmmaker  Bernardo  Bertolucci,  the  car  maker  Sergio  Pininfarina,  and  the  Fiat\nheiress and politician Susanna Agnelli. “I had come to revere the Italian designers, just\nlike the kid in Breaking Away reveres the Italian bikers,” recalled Jobs, “so it was an\namazing inspiration.”\nIn  Aspen  he  was  exposed  to  the  spare  and  functional  design  philosophy  of  the\nBauhaus  movement,  which  was  enshrined  by  Herbert  Bayer  in  the  buildings,  living\nsuites, sans serif font typography, and furniture on the Aspen Institute campus. Like his\n\nmentors  Walter  Gropius  and  Ludwig  Mies  van  der  Rohe,  Bayer  believed  that  there\nshould be no distinction between fine art and applied industrial design. The modernist\nInternational Style championed by the Bauhaus taught that design should be simple, yet\nhave an expressive spirit. It emphasized rationality and functionality by employing clean\nlines and forms. Among the maxims preached by Mies and Gropius were “God is in the\ndetails”  and  “Less  is  more.”  As  with  Eichler  homes,  the  artistic  sensibility  was\ncombined with the capability for mass production.\nJobs publicly discussed his embrace of the Bauhaus style in a talk he gave at the\n1983 design conference, the theme of which was “The Future Isn’t What It Used to Be.”\nHe predicted the passing of the Sony style in favor of Bauhaus simplicity. “The current\nwave of industrial design is Sony’s high-tech look, which is gunmetal gray, maybe paint\nit black, do weird stuff to it,” he said. “It’s easy to do that. But it’s not great.” He\nproposed an alternative, born of the Bauhaus, that was more true to the function and\nnature of the products. “What we’re going to do is make the products high-tech, and\nwe’re going to package them cleanly so that you know they’re high-tech. We will fit\nthem in a small package, and then we can make them beautiful and white, just like Braun\ndoes with its electronics.”\nHe repeatedly emphasized that Apple’s products would be clean and simple. “We\nwill make them bright and pure and honest about being high-tech, rather than a heavy\nindustrial look of black, black, black, black, like Sony,” he preached. “So that’s our\napproach. Very simple, and we’re really shooting for Museum of Modern Art quality.\nThe way we’re running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes\ndown  to  this:  Let’s  make  it  simple.  Really  simple.”  Apple’s  design  mantra  would\nremain the one featured on its first brochure: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”\nJobs  felt  that  design  simplicity  should  be  linked  to  making  products  easy  to  use.\nThose goals do not always go together. Sometimes a design can be so sleek and simple\nthat a user finds it intimidating or unfriendly to navigate. “The main thing in our design\nis  that  we  have  to  make  things  intuitively  obvious,”  Jobs  told  the  crowd  of  design\nmavens.  For  example,  he  extolled  the  desktop  metaphor  he  was  creating  for  the\nMacintosh. “People know how to deal with a desktop intuitively. If you walk into an\noffice, there are papers on the desk. The one on the top is the most important. People\nknow how to switch priority. Part of the reason we model our computers on metaphors\nlike the desktop is that we can leverage this experience people already have.”\nSpeaking  at  the  same  time  as  Jobs  that  Wednesday  afternoon,  but  in  a  smaller\nseminar  room,  was  Maya  Lin,  twenty-three,  who  had  been  catapulted  into  fame  the\nprevious  November  when  her  Vietnam  Veterans  Memorial  was  dedicated  in\nWashington, D.C. They struck up a close friendship, and Jobs invited her to visit Apple.\n“I came to work with Steve for a week,” Lin recalled. “I asked him, ‘Why do computers\nlook like clunky TV sets? Why don’t you make something thin? Why not a flat laptop?’”\nJobs replied that this was indeed his goal, as soon as the technology was ready.\n\nAt that time there was not much exciting happening in the realm of industrial design,\nJobs  felt.  He  had  a  Richard  Sapper  lamp,  which  he  admired,  and  he  also  liked  the\nfurniture of Charles and Ray Eames and the Braun products of Dieter Rams. But there\nwere  no  towering  figures  energizing  the  world  of  industrial  design  the  way  that\nRaymond Loewy and Herbert Bayer had done. “There really wasn’t much going on in\nindustrial design, particularly in Silicon Valley, and Steve was very eager to change\nthat,”  said  Lin.  “His  design  sensibility  is  sleek  but  not  slick,  and  it’s  playful.  He\nembraced minimalism, which came from his Zen devotion to simplicity, but he avoided\nallowing that to make his products cold. They stayed fun. He’s passionate and super-\nserious about design, but at the same time there’s a sense of play.”\nAs  Jobs’s  design  sensibilities  evolved,  he  became  particularly  attracted  to  the\nJapanese style and began hanging out with its stars, such as Issey Miyake. His Buddhist\ntraining was a big influence. “I have always found Buddhism, Japanese Zen Buddhism\nin particular, to be aesthetically sublime,” he said. “The most sublime thing I’ve ever\nseen  are  the  gardens  around  Kyoto.  I’m  deeply  moved  by  what  that  culture  has\nproduced, and it’s directly from Zen Buddhism.”\nLike a Porsche\nJef Raskin’s vision for the Macintosh was that it would be like a boxy carry-on suitcase,\nwhich would be closed by flipping up the keyboard over the front screen. When Jobs\ntook over the project, he decided to sacrifice portability for a distinctive design that\nwouldn’t take up much space on a desk. He plopped down a phone book and declared,\nto the horror of the engineers, that it shouldn’t have a footprint larger than that. So his\ndesign team of Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama began working on ideas that had the\nscreen above the computer box, with a keyboard that was detachable.\nOne day in March 1981, Andy Hertzfeld came back to the office from dinner to find\nJobs  hovering  over  their  one  Mac  prototype  in  intense  discussion  with  the  creative\nservices director, James Ferris. “We need it to have a classic look that won’t go out of\nstyle,  like  the  Volkswagen  Beetle,”  Jobs  said.  From  his  father  he  had  developed  an\nappreciation for the contours of classic cars.\n“No,  that’s  not  right,”  Ferris  replied.  “The  lines  should  be  voluptuous,  like  a\nFerrari.”\n“Not a Ferrari, that’s not right either,” Jobs countered. “It should be more like a\nPorsche!” Jobs owned a Porsche 928 at the time. When Bill Atkinson was over one\nweekend, Jobs brought him outside to admire the car. “Great art stretches the taste, it\ndoesn’t follow tastes,” he told Atkinson. He also admired the design of the Mercedes.\n“Over the years, they’ve made the lines softer but the details starker,” he said one day\nas he walked around the parking lot. “That’s what we have to do with the Macintosh.”\n\nOyama drafted a preliminary design and had a plaster model made. The Mac team\ngathered  around  for  the  unveiling  and  expressed  their  thoughts.  Hertzfeld  called  it\n“cute.” Others also seemed satisfied. Then Jobs let loose a blistering burst of criticism.\n“It’s way too boxy, it’s got to be more curvaceous. The radius of the first chamfer needs\nto be bigger, and I don’t like the size of the bevel.” With his new fluency in industrial\ndesign lingo, Jobs was referring to the angular or curved edge connecting the sides of\nthe computer. But then he gave a resounding compliment. “It’s a start,” he said.\nEvery  month  or  so,  Manock  and  Oyama  would  present  a  new  iteration  based  on\nJobs’s previous criticisms. The latest plaster model would be dramatically unveiled,\nand all the previous attempts would be lined up next to it. That not only helped them\ngauge  the  design’s  evolution,  but  it  prevented  Jobs  from  insisting  that  one  of  his\nsuggestions had been ignored. “By the fourth model, I could barely distinguish it from\nthe third one,” said Hertzfeld, “but Steve was always critical and decisive, saying he\nloved or hated a detail that I could barely perceive.”\nOne  weekend  Jobs  went  to  Macy’s  in  Palo  Alto  and  again  spent  time  studying\nappliances,  especially  the  Cuisinart.  He  came  bounding  into  the  Mac  office  that\nMonday, asked the design team to go buy one, and made a raft of new suggestions based\non its lines, curves, and bevels.\nJobs kept insisting that the machine should look friendly. As a result, it evolved to\nresemble a human face. With the disk drive built in below the screen, the unit was taller\nand narrower than most computers, suggesting a head. The recess near the base evoked\na gentle chin, and Jobs narrowed the strip of plastic at the top so that it avoided the\nNeanderthal forehead that made the Lisa subtly unattractive. The patent for the design of\nthe Apple case was issued in the name of Steve Jobs as well as Manock and Oyama.\n“Even though Steve didn’t draw any of the lines, his ideas and inspiration made the\ndesign what it is,” Oyama later said. “To be honest, we didn’t know what it meant for a\ncomputer to be ‘friendly’ until Steve told us.”\nJobs  obsessed  with  equal  intensity  about  the  look  of  what  would  appear  on  the\nscreen. One day Bill Atkinson burst into Texaco Towers all excited. He had just come\nup with a brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly. The\nmath  for  making  circles  usually  required  calculating  square  roots,  which  the  68000\nmicroprocessor didn’t support. But Atkinson did a workaround based on the fact that the\nsum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect squares (for example,\n1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, etc.). Hertzfeld recalled that when Atkinson fired up his demo,\neveryone was impressed except Jobs. “Well, circles and ovals are good,” he said, “but\nhow about drawing rectangles with rounded corners?”\n“I don’t think we really need it,” said Atkinson, who explained that it would be\nalmost impossible to do. “I wanted to keep the graphics routines lean and limit them to\nthe primitives that truly needed to be done,” he recalled.\n“Rectangles  with  rounded  corners  are  everywhere!”  Jobs  said,  jumping  up  and\ngetting more intense. “Just look around this room!” He pointed out the whiteboard and\n\nthe tabletop and other objects that were rectangular with rounded corners. “And look\noutside, there’s even more, practically everywhere you look!” He dragged Atkinson out\nfor a walk, pointing out car windows and billboards and street signs. “Within three\nblocks,  we  found  seventeen  examples,”  said  Jobs.  “I  started  pointing  them  out\neverywhere until he was completely convinced.”\n“When he finally got to a No Parking sign, I said, ‘Okay, you’re right, I give up. We\nneed  to  have  a  rounded-corner  rectangle  as  a  primitive!’”  Hertzfeld  recalled,  “Bill\nreturned to Texaco Towers the following afternoon, with a big smile on his face. His\ndemo was now drawing rectangles with beautifully rounded corners blisteringly fast.”\nThe  dialogue  boxes  and  windows  on  the  Lisa  and  the  Mac,  and  almost  every  other\nsubsequent computer, ended up being rendered with rounded corners.\nAt the calligraphy class he had audited at Reed, Jobs learned to love typefaces, with\nall of their serif and sans serif variations, proportional spacing, and leading. “When we\nwere designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me,” he later said of\nthat class. Because the Mac was bitmapped, it was possible to devise an endless array\nof fonts, ranging from the elegant to the wacky, and render them pixel by pixel on the\nscreen.\nTo  design  these  fonts,  Hertzfeld  recruited  a  high  school  friend  from  suburban\nPhiladelphia, Susan Kare. They named the fonts after the stops on Philadelphia’s Main\nLine  commuter  train:  Overbrook,  Merion,  Ardmore,  and  Rosemont.  Jobs  found  the\nprocess fascinating. Late one afternoon he stopped by and started brooding about the\nfont names. They were “little cities that nobody’s ever heard of,” he complained. “They\nought to be world-class cities!” The fonts were renamed Chicago, New York, Geneva,\nLondon, San Francisco, Toronto, and Venice.\nMarkkula  and  some  others  could  never  quite  appreciate  Jobs’s  obsession  with\ntypography. “His knowledge of fonts was remarkable, and he kept insisting on having\ngreat ones,” Markkula recalled. “I kept saying, ‘Fonts?!? Don’t we have more important\nthings to do?’” In fact the delightful assortment of Macintosh fonts, when combined with\nlaser-writer  printing  and  great  graphics  capabilities,  would  help  launch  the  desktop\npublishing industry and be a boon for Apple’s bottom line. It also introduced all sorts of\nregular  folks,  ranging  from  high  school  journalists  to  moms  who  edited  PTA\nnewsletters,  to  the  quirky  joy  of  knowing  about  fonts,  which  was  once  reserved  for\nprinters, grizzled editors, and other ink-stained wretches.\nKare also developed the icons, such as the trash can for discarding files, that helped\ndefine graphical interfaces. She and Jobs hit it off because they shared an instinct for\nsimplicity along with a desire to make the Mac whimsical. “He usually came in at the\nend  of  every  day,”  she  said.  “He’d  always  want  to  know  what  was  new,  and  he’s\nalways had good taste and a good sense for visual details.” Sometimes he came in on\nSunday morning, so Kare made it a point to be there working. Every now and then, she\nwould run into a problem. He rejected one of her renderings of a rabbit, an icon for\nspeeding up the mouse-click rate, saying that the furry creature looked “too gay.”\n\nJobs lavished similar attention on the title bars atop windows and documents. He\nhad Atkinson and Kare do them over and over again as he agonized over their look. He\ndid not like the ones on the Lisa because they were too black and harsh. He wanted the\nones on the Mac to be smoother, to have pinstripes. “We must have gone through twenty\ndifferent title bar designs before he was happy,” Atkinson recalled. At one point Kare\nand Atkinson complained that he was making them spend too much time on tiny little\ntweaks  to  the  title  bar  when  they  had  bigger  things  to  do.  Jobs  erupted.  “Can  you\nimagine looking at that every day?” he shouted. “It’s not just a little thing, it’s something\nwe have to do right.”\nChris Espinosa found one way to satisfy Jobs’s design demands and control-freak\ntendencies. One of Wozniak’s youthful acolytes from the days in the garage, Espinosa\nhad been convinced to drop out of Berkeley by Jobs, who argued that he would always\nhave a chance to study, but only one chance to work on the Mac. On his own, he decided\nto design a calculator for the computer. “We all gathered around as Chris showed the\ncalculator to Steve and then held his breath, waiting for Steve’s reaction,” Hertzfeld\nrecalled.\n“Well, it’s a start,” Jobs said, “but basically, it stinks. The background color is too\ndark, some lines are the wrong thickness, and the buttons are too big.” Espinosa kept\nrefining it in response to Jobs’s critiques, day after day, but with each iteration came\nnew criticisms. So finally one afternoon, when Jobs came by, Espinosa unveiled his\ninspired  solution:  “The  Steve  Jobs  Roll  Your  Own  Calculator  Construction  Set.”  It\nallowed the user to tweak and personalize the look of the calculator by changing the\nthickness of the lines, the size of the buttons, the shading, the background, and other\nattributes. Instead of just laughing, Jobs plunged in and started to play around with the\nlook to suit his tastes. After about ten minutes he got it the way he liked. His design, not\nsurprisingly, was the one that shipped on the Mac and remained the standard for fifteen\nyears.\nAlthough his focus was on the Macintosh, Jobs wanted to create a consistent design\nlanguage for all Apple products. So he set up a contest to choose a world-class designer\nwho  would  be  for  Apple  what  Dieter  Rams  was  for  Braun.  The  project  was  code-\nnamed Snow White, not because of his preference for the color but because the products\nto  be  designed  were  code-named  after  the  seven  dwarfs.  The  winner  was  Hartmut\nEsslinger,  a  German  designer  who  was  responsible  for  the  look  of  Sony’s  Trinitron\ntelevisions. Jobs flew to the Black Forest region to meet him and was impressed not\nonly with Esslinger’s passion but also his spirited way of driving his Mercedes at more\nthan one hundred miles per hour.\nEven though he was German, Esslinger proposed that there should be a “born-in-\nAmerica  gene  for  Apple’s  DNA”  that  would  produce  a  “California  global”  look,\ninspired by “Hollywood and music, a bit of rebellion, and natural sex appeal.” His\nguiding principle was “Form follows emotion,” a play on the familiar maxim that form\nfollows function. He produced forty models of products to demonstrate the concept, and\n\nwhen Jobs saw them he proclaimed, “Yes, this is it!” The Snow White look, which was\nadopted immediately for the Apple IIc, featured white cases, tight rounded curves, and\nlines  of  thin  grooves  for  both  ventilation  and  decoration.  Jobs  offered  Esslinger  a\ncontract  on  the  condition  that  he  move  to  California.  They  shook  hands  and,  in\nEsslinger’s not-so-modest words, “that handshake launched one of the most decisive\ncollaborations in the history of industrial design.” Esslinger’s firm, frogdesign,\n*\n opened\nin Palo Alto in mid-1983 with a $1.2 million annual contract to work for Apple, and\nfrom  then  on  every  Apple  product  has  included  the  proud  declaration  “Designed  in\nCalifornia.”\nFrom his father Jobs had learned that a hallmark of passionate craftsmanship is making\nsure that even the aspects that will remain hidden are done beautifully. One of the most\nextreme—and telling—implementations of that philosophy came when he scrutinized the\nprinted circuit board that would hold the chips and other components deep inside the\nMacintosh. No consumer would ever see it, but Jobs began critiquing it on aesthetic\ngrounds. “That part’s really pretty,” he said. “But look at the memory chips. That’s ugly.\nThe lines are too close together.”\nOne of the new engineers interrupted and asked why it mattered. “The only thing\nthat’s important is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”\nJobs reacted typically. “I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the\nbox. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even\nthough nobody’s going to see it.” In an interview a few years later, after the Macintosh\ncame out, Jobs again reiterated that lesson from his father: “When you’re a carpenter\nmaking a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the\nback, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there,\nso you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at\nnight, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”\nFrom Mike Markkula he had learned the importance of packaging and presentation.\nPeople do judge a book by its cover, so for the box of the Macintosh, Jobs chose a full-\ncolor design and kept trying to make it look better. “He got the guys to redo it fifty\ntimes,”  recalled  Alain  Rossmann,  a  member  of  the  Mac  team  who  married  Joanna\nHoffman. “It was going to be thrown in the trash as soon as the consumer opened it, but\nhe  was  obsessed  by  how  it  looked.”  To  Rossmann,  this  showed  a  lack  of  balance;\nmoney was being spent on expensive packaging while they were trying to save money\non the memory chips. But for Jobs, each detail was essential to making the Macintosh\namazing.\nWhen the design was finally locked in, Jobs called the Macintosh team together for a\nceremony. “Real artists sign their work,” he said. So he got out a sheet of drafting paper\nand a Sharpie pen and had all of them sign their names. The signatures were engraved\ninside each Macintosh. No one would ever see them, but the members of the team knew\n\nthat their signatures were inside, just as they knew that the circuit board was laid out as\nelegantly as possible. Jobs called them each up by name, one at a time. Burrell Smith\nwent first. Jobs waited until last, after all forty-five of the others. He found a place right\nin the center of the sheet and signed his name in lowercase letters with a grand flair.\nThen he toasted them with champagne. “With moments like this, he got us seeing our\nwork as art,” said Atkinson.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\nBUILDING THE MAC\nThe Journey Is the Reward\nCompetition\nWhen IBM introduced its personal computer in August 1981, Jobs had his team buy one\nand dissect it. Their consensus was that it sucked. Chris Espinosa called it “a half-\nassed,  hackneyed  attempt,”  and  there  was  some  truth  to  that.  It  used  old-fashioned\ncommand-line prompts and didn’t support bitmapped graphical displays. Apple became\ncocky, not realizing that corporate technology managers might feel more comfortable\nbuying from an established company like IBM rather than one named after a piece of\nfruit. Bill Gates happened to be visiting Apple headquarters for a meeting on the day the\nIBM PC was announced. “They didn’t seem to care,” he said. “It took them a year to\nrealize what had happened.”\nReflecting its cheeky confidence, Apple took out a full-page ad in the Wall  Street\nJournal  with  the  headline  “Welcome,  IBM.  Seriously.”  It  cleverly  positioned  the\nupcoming computer battle as a two-way contest between the spunky and rebellious\nApple  and  the  establishment  Goliath  IBM,  conveniently  relegating  to  irrelevance\ncompanies such as Commodore, Tandy, and Osborne that were doing just as well as\nApple.\nThroughout  his  career,  Jobs  liked  to  see  himself  as  an  enlightened  rebel  pitted\nagainst evil empires, a Jedi warrior or Buddhist samurai fighting the forces of darkness.\nIBM was his perfect foil. He cleverly cast the upcoming battle not as a mere business\ncompetition,  but  as  a  spiritual  struggle.  “If,  for  some  reason,  we  make  some  giant\nmistakes and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going to enter sort of a\ncomputer Dark Ages for about twenty years,” he told an interviewer. “Once IBM gains\ncontrol of a market sector, they almost always stop innovation.” Even thirty years later,\n\nreflecting back on the competition, Jobs cast it as a holy crusade: “IBM was essentially\nMicrosoft at its worst. They were not a force for innovation; they were a force for evil.\nThey were like ATT or Microsoft or Google is.”\nUnfortunately for Apple, Jobs also took aim at another perceived competitor to his\nMacintosh: the company’s own Lisa. Partly it was psychological. He had been ousted\nfrom that group, and now he wanted to beat it. He also saw healthy rivalry as a way to\nmotivate his troops. That’s why he bet John Couch $5,000 that the Mac would ship\nbefore the Lisa. The problem was that the rivalry became unhealthy. Jobs repeatedly\nportrayed his band of engineers as the cool kids on the block, in contrast to the plodding\nHP engineer types working on the Lisa.\nMore substantively, when he moved away from Jef Raskin’s plan for an inexpensive\nand underpowered portable appliance and reconceived the Mac as a desktop machine\nwith a graphical user interface, it became a scaled-down version of the Lisa that would\nlikely undercut it in the marketplace.\nLarry Tesler, who managed application software for the Lisa, realized that it would\nbe important to design both machines to use many of the same software programs. So to\nbroker peace, he arranged for Smith and Hertzfeld to come to the Lisa work space and\ndemonstrate the Mac prototype. Twenty-five engineers showed up and were listening\npolitely when, halfway into the presentation, the door burst open. It was Rich Page, a\nvolatile engineer who was responsible for much of the Lisa’s design. “The Macintosh is\ngoing to destroy the Lisa!” he shouted. “The Macintosh is going to ruin Apple!” Neither\nSmith nor Hertzfeld responded, so Page continued his rant. “Jobs wants to destroy Lisa\nbecause we wouldn’t let him control it,” he said, looking as if he were about to cry.\n“Nobody’s going to buy a Lisa because they know the Mac is coming! But you don’t\ncare!” He stormed out of the room and slammed the door, but a moment later he barged\nback in briefly. “I know it’s not your fault,” he said to Smith and Hertzfeld. “Steve Jobs\nis the problem. Tell Steve that he’s destroying Apple!”\nJobs did indeed make the Macintosh into a low-cost competitor to the Lisa, one with\nincompatible software. Making matters worse was that neither machine was compatible\nwith the Apple II. With no one in overall charge at Apple, there was no chance of\nkeeping Jobs in harness.\nEnd-to-end Control\nJobs’s reluctance to make the Mac compatible with the architecture of the Lisa was\nmotivated by more than rivalry or revenge. There was a philosophical component, one\nthat was related to his penchant for control. He believed that for a computer to be truly\n\ngreat, its hardware and its software had to be tightly linked. When a computer was open\nto running software that also worked on other computers, it would end up sacrificing\nsome functionality. The best products, he believed, were “whole widgets” that were\ndesigned end-to-end, with the software closely tailored to the hardware and vice versa.\nThis  is  what  would  distinguish  the  Macintosh,  which  had  an  operating  system  that\nworked only on its own hardware, from the environment that Microsoft was creating, in\nwhich  its  operating  system  could  be  used  on  hardware  made  by  many  different\ncompanies.\n“Jobs  is  a  strong-willed,  elitist  artist  who  doesn’t  want  his  creations  mutated\ninauspiciously by unworthy programmers,” explained ZDNet’s editor Dan Farber. “It\nwould be as if someone off the street added some brush strokes to a Picasso painting or\nchanged the lyrics to a Dylan song.” In later years Jobs’s whole-widget approach would\ndistinguish the iPhone, iPod, and iPad from their competitors. It resulted in awesome\nproducts. But it was not always the best strategy for dominating a market. “From the\nfirst Mac to the latest iPhone, Jobs’s systems have always been sealed shut to prevent\nconsumers from meddling and modifying them,” noted Leander Kahney, author of Cult\nof the Mac.\nJobs’s desire to control the user experience had been at the heart of his debate with\nWozniak over whether the Apple II would have slots that allow a user to plug expansion\ncards into a computer’s motherboard and thus add some new functionality. Wozniak won\nthat argument: The Apple II had eight slots. But this time around it would be Jobs’s\nmachine, not Wozniak’s, and the Macintosh would have limited slots. You wouldn’t\neven be able to open the case and get to the motherboard. For a hobbyist or hacker, that\nwas uncool. But for Jobs, the Macintosh was for the masses. He wanted to give them a\ncontrolled experience.\n“It reflects his personality, which is to want control,” said Berry Cash, who was\nhired by Jobs in 1982 to be a market strategist at Texaco Towers. “Steve would talk\nabout the Apple II and complain, ‘We don’t have control, and look at all these crazy\nthings people are trying to do to it. That’s a mistake I’ll never make again.’” He went so\nfar as to design special tools so that the Macintosh case could not be opened with a\nregular screwdriver. “We’re going to design this thing so nobody but Apple employees\ncan get inside this box,” he told Cash.\nJobs also decided to eliminate the cursor arrow keys on the Macintosh keyboard.\nThe only way to move the cursor was to use the mouse. It was a way of forcing old-\nfashioned users to adapt to point-and-click navigation, even if they didn’t want to.\nUnlike other product developers, Jobs did not believe the customer was always right; if\nthey wanted to resist using a mouse, they were wrong.\nThere was one other advantage, he believed, to eliminating the cursor keys: It forced\noutside software developers to write programs specially for the Mac operating system,\nrather  than  merely  writing  generic  software  that  could  be  ported  to  a  variety  of\n\ncomputers.  That  made  for  the  type  of  tight  vertical  integration  between  application\nsoftware, operating systems, and hardware devices that Jobs liked.\nJobs’s desire for end-to-end control also made him allergic to proposals that Apple\nlicense the Macintosh operating system to other office equipment manufacturers and\nallow them to make Macintosh clones. The new and energetic Macintosh marketing\ndirector Mike Murray proposed a licensing program in a confidential memo to Jobs in\nMay 1982. “We would like the Macintosh user environment to become an industry\nstandard,” he wrote. “The hitch, of course, is that now one must buy Mac hardware in\norder to get this user environment. Rarely (if ever) has one company been able to create\nand maintain an industry-wide standard that cannot be shared with other manufacturers.”\nHis proposal was to license the Macintosh operating system to Tandy. Because Tandy’s\nRadio Shack stores went after a different type of customer, Murray argued, it would not\nseverely cannibalize Apple sales. But Jobs was congenitally averse to such a plan. His\napproach  meant  that  the  Macintosh  remained  a  controlled  environment  that  met his\nstandards, but it also meant that, as Murray feared, it would have trouble securing its\nplace as an industry standard in a world of IBM clones.\nMachines of the Year\nAs 1982 drew to a close, Jobs came to believe that he was going to be Time’s Man of\nthe Year. He arrived at Texaco Towers one day with the magazine’s San Francisco\nbureau chief, Michael Moritz, and encouraged colleagues to give Moritz interviews. But\nJobs did not end up on the cover. Instead the magazine chose “the Computer” as the\ntopic for the year-end issue and called it “the Machine of the Year.”\nAccompanying  the  main  story  was  a  profile  of  Jobs,  which  was  based  on  the\nreporting done by Moritz and written by Jay Cocks, an editor who usually handled rock\nmusic for the magazine. “With his smooth sales pitch and a blind faith that would have\nbeen the envy of the early Christian martyrs, it is Steven Jobs, more than anyone, who\nkicked open the door and let the personal computer move in,” the story proclaimed. It\nwas a richly reported piece, but also harsh at times—so harsh that Moritz (after he\nwrote a book about Apple and went on to be a partner in the venture firm Sequoia\nCapital with Don Valentine) repudiated it by complaining that his reporting had been\n“siphoned,  filtered,  and  poisoned  with  gossipy  benzene  by  an  editor  in  New  York\nwhose regular task was to chronicle the wayward world of rock-and-roll music.” The\narticle quoted Bud Tribble on Jobs’s “reality distortion field” and noted that he “would\noccasionally burst into tears at meetings.” Perhaps the best quote came from Jef Raskin.\nJobs, he declared, “would have made an excellent King of France.”\nTo Jobs’s dismay, the magazine made public the existence of the daughter he had\nforsaken, Lisa Brennan. He knew that Kottke had been the one to tell the magazine about\n\nLisa, and he berated him in the Mac group work space in front of a half dozen people.\n“When the Time reporter asked me if Steve had a daughter named Lisa, I said ‘Of\ncourse,’” Kottke recalled. “Friends don’t let friends deny that they’re the father of a\nchild. I’m not going to let my friend be a jerk and deny paternity. He was really angry\nand felt violated and told me in front of everyone that I had betrayed him.”\nBut what truly devastated Jobs was that he was not, after all, chosen as the Man of\nthe Year. As he later told me:\nTime decided they were going to make me Man of the Year, and I was twenty-seven, so I\nactually cared about stuff like that. I thought it was pretty cool. They sent out Mike\nMoritz to write a story. We’re the same age, and I had been very successful, and I could\ntell he was jealous and there was an edge to him. He wrote this terrible hatchet job. So\nthe editors in New York get this story and say, “We can’t make this guy Man of the\nYear.” That really hurt. But it was a good lesson. It taught me to never get too excited\nabout  things  like  that,  since  the  media  is  a  circus  anyway.  They  FedExed  me  the\nmagazine, and I remember opening the package, thoroughly expecting to see my mug on\nthe cover, and it was this computer sculpture thing. I thought, “Huh?” And then I read the\narticle, and it was so awful that I actually cried.\nIn fact there’s no reason to believe that Moritz was jealous or that he intended his\nreporting to be unfair. Nor was Jobs ever slated to be Man of the Year, despite what he\nthought. That year the top editors (I was then a junior editor there) decided early on to\ngo with the computer rather than a person, and they commissioned, months in advance, a\npiece of art from the famous sculptor George Segal to be a gatefold cover image. Ray\nCave  was  then  the  magazine’s  editor.  “We  never  considered  Jobs,”  he  said.  “You\ncouldn’t personify the computer, so that was the first time we decided to go with an\ninanimate object. We never searched around for a face to be put on the cover.”\nApple launched the Lisa in January 1983—a full year before the Mac was ready—and\nJobs paid his $5,000 wager to Couch. Even though he was not part of the Lisa team,\nJobs went to New York to do publicity for it in his role as Apple’s chairman and poster\nboy.\nHe had learned from his public relations consultant Regis McKenna how to dole out\nexclusive interviews in a dramatic manner. Reporters from anointed publications were\nushered in sequentially for their hour with him in his Carlyle Hotel suite, where a Lisa\ncomputer was set on a table and surrounded by cut flowers. The publicity plan called\nfor Jobs to focus on the Lisa and not mention the Macintosh, because speculation about\nit could undermine the Lisa. But Jobs couldn’t help himself. In most of the stories based\n\non  his  interviews  that  day—in Time,  Business  Week,  the Wall  Street  Journal,  and\nFortune—the Macintosh was mentioned. “Later this year Apple will introduce a less\npowerful, less expensive version of Lisa, the Macintosh,” Fortune  reported.  “Jobs\nhimself has directed that project.” Business Week quoted him as saying, “When it comes\nout, Mac is going to be the most incredible computer in the world.” He also admitted\nthat the Mac and the Lisa would not be compatible. It was like launching the Lisa with\nthe kiss of death.\nThe Lisa did indeed die a slow death. Within two years it would be discontinued. “It\nwas too expensive, and we were trying to sell it to big companies when our expertise\nwas selling to consumers,” Jobs later said. But there was a silver lining for Jobs:\nWithin months of Lisa’s launch, it became clear that Apple had to pin its hopes on the\nMacintosh instead.\nLet’s Be Pirates!\nAs the Macintosh team grew, it moved from Texaco Towers to the main Apple buildings\non Bandley Drive, finally settling in mid-1983 into Bandley 3. It had a modern atrium\nlobby with video games, which Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld chose, and a Toshiba\ncompact  disc  stereo  system  with  MartinLogan  speakers  and  a  hundred  CDs.  The\nsoftware team was visible from the lobby in a fishbowl-like glass enclosure, and the\nkitchen was stocked daily with Odwalla juices. Over time the atrium attracted even\nmore toys, most notably a Bösendorfer piano and a BMW motorcycle that Jobs felt\nwould inspire an obsession with lapidary craftsmanship.\nJobs kept a tight rein on the hiring process. The goal was to get people who were\ncreative,  wickedly  smart,  and  slightly  rebellious.  The  software  team  would  make\napplicants play Defender, Smith’s favorite video game. Jobs would ask his usual offbeat\nquestions to see how well the applicant could think in unexpected situations. One day\nhe, Hertzfeld, and Smith interviewed a candidate for software manager who, it became\nclear as soon as he walked in the room, was too uptight and conventional to manage the\nwizards in the fishbowl. Jobs began to toy with him mercilessly. “How old were you\nwhen you lost your virginity?” he asked.\nThe candidate looked baffled. “What did you say?”\n“Are you a virgin?” Jobs asked. The candidate sat there flustered, so Jobs changed\nthe subject. “How many times have you taken LSD?” Hertzfeld recalled, “The poor guy\nwas  turning  varying  shades  of  red,  so  I  tried  to  change  the  subject  and  asked  a\nstraightforward technical question.” But when the candidate droned on in his response,\nJobs  broke  in.  “Gobble,  gobble,  gobble,  gobble,”  he  said,  cracking  up  Smith  and\nHertzfeld.\n“I guess I’m not the right guy,” the poor man said as he got up to leave.\n\nFor all of his obnoxious behavior, Jobs also had the ability to instill in his team an\nesprit de corps. After tearing people down, he would find ways to lift them up and make\nthem feel that being part of the Macintosh project was an amazing mission. Every six\nmonths he would take most of his team on a two-day retreat at a nearby resort.\nThe retreat in September 1982 was at the Pajaro Dunes near Monterey. Fifty or so\nmembers of the Mac division sat in the lodge facing a fireplace. Jobs sat on top of a\ntable in front of them. He spoke quietly for a while, then walked to an easel and began\nposting his thoughts.\nThe first was “Don’t compromise.” It was an injunction that would, over time, be\nboth helpful and harmful. Most technology teams made trade-offs. The Mac, on the other\nhand, would end up being as “insanely great” as Jobs and his acolytes could possibly\nmake it—but it would not ship for another sixteen months, way behind schedule. After\nmentioning a scheduled completion date, he told them, “It would be better to miss than\nto turn out the wrong thing.” A different type of project manager, willing to make some\ntrade-offs, might try to lock in dates after which no changes could be made. Not Jobs.\nHe displayed another maxim: “It’s not done until it ships.”\nAnother chart contained a kan-like phrase that he later told me was his favorite\nmaxim: “The journey is the reward.” The Mac team, he liked to emphasize, was a\nspecial corps with an exalted mission. Someday they would all look back on their\njourney together and, forgetting or laughing off the painful moments, would regard it as a\nmagical high point in their lives.\nAt the end of the presentation someone asked whether he thought they should do\nsome  market  research  to  see  what  customers  wanted.  “No,”  he  replied,  “because\ncustomers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.” Then he pulled out a\ndevice that was about the size of a desk diary. “Do you want to see something neat?”\nWhen he flipped it open, it turned out to be a mock-up of a computer that could fit on\nyour lap, with a keyboard and screen hinged together like a notebook. “This is my\ndream of what we will be making in the mid- to late eighties,” he said. They were\nbuilding a company that would invent the future.\nFor the next two days there were presentations by various team leaders and the\ninfluential computer industry analyst Ben Rosen, with a lot of time in the evenings for\npool parties and dancing. At the end, Jobs stood in front of the assemblage and gave a\nsoliloquy. “As every day passes, the work fifty people are doing here is going to send a\ngiant ripple through the universe,” he said. “I know I might be a little hard to get along\nwith, but this is the most fun thing I’ve done in my life.” Years later most of those in the\naudience would be able to laugh about the “little hard to get along with” episodes and\nagree with him that creating that giant ripple was the most fun they had in their lives.\nThe next retreat was at the end of January 1983, the same month the Lisa launched,\nand there was a shift in tone. Four months earlier Jobs had written on his flip chart:\n“Don’t compromise.” This time one of the maxims was “Real artists ship.” Nerves\nwere frayed. Atkinson had been left out of the publicity interviews for the Lisa launch,\n\nand he marched into Jobs’s hotel room and threatened to quit. Jobs tried to minimize the\nslight, but Atkinson refused to be mollified. Jobs got annoyed. “I don’t have time to deal\nwith this now,” he said. “I have sixty other people out there who are pouring their hearts\ninto the Macintosh, and they’re waiting for me to start the meeting.” With that he brushed\npast Atkinson to go address the faithful.\nJobs proceeded to give a rousing speech in which he claimed that he had resolved\nthe dispute with McIntosh audio labs to use the Macintosh name. (In fact the issue was\nstill being negotiated, but the moment called for a bit of the old reality distortion field.)\nHe  pulled  out  a  bottle  of  mineral  water  and  symbolically  christened  the  prototype\nonstage. Down the hall, Atkinson heard the loud cheer, and with a sigh joined the group.\nThe ensuing party featured skinny-dipping in the pool, a bonfire on the beach, and loud\nmusic that lasted all night, which caused the hotel, La Playa in Carmel, to ask them\nnever to come back.\nAnother of Jobs’s maxims at the retreat was “It’s better to be a pirate than to join the\nnavy.”  He  wanted  to  instill  a  rebel  spirit  in  his  team,  to  have  them  behave  like\nswashbucklers who were proud of their work but willing to commandeer from others.\nAs Susan Kare put it, “He meant, ‘Let’s have a renegade feeling to our group. We can\nmove fast. We can get things done.’” To celebrate Jobs’s birthday a few weeks later, the\nteam paid for a billboard on the road to Apple headquarters. It read: “Happy 28th\nSteve. The Journey is the Reward.—The Pirates.”\nOne  of  the  Mac  team’s  programmers,  Steve  Capps,  decided  this  new  spirit\nwarranted hoisting a Jolly Roger. He cut a patch of black cloth and had Kare paint a\nskull and crossbones on it. The eye patch she put on the skull was an Apple logo. Late\none Sunday night Capps climbed to the roof of their newly built Bandley 3 building and\nhoisted the flag on a scaffolding pole that the construction workers had left behind. It\nwaved proudly for a few weeks, until members of the Lisa team, in a late-night foray,\nstole the flag and sent their Mac rivals a ransom note. Capps led a raid to recover it and\nwas able to wrestle it from a secretary who was guarding it for the Lisa team. Some of\nthe grown-ups overseeing Apple worried that Jobs’s buccaneer spirit was getting out of\nhand. “Flying that flag was really stupid,” said Arthur Rock. “It was telling the rest of\nthe company they were no good.” But Jobs loved it, and he made sure it waved proudly\nall the way through to the completion of the Mac project. “We were the renegades, and\nwe wanted people to know it,” he recalled.\nVeterans of the Mac team had learned that they could stand up to Jobs. If they knew what\nthey were talking about, he would tolerate the pushback, even admire it. By 1983 those\nmost familiar with his reality distortion field had discovered something further: They\ncould, if necessary, just quietly disregard what he decreed. If they turned out to be right,\nhe would appreciate their renegade attitude and willingness to ignore authority. After\nall, that’s what he did.\n\nBy far the most important example of this involved the choice of a disk drive for the\nMacintosh. Apple had a corporate division that built mass-storage devices, and it had\ndeveloped a disk-drive system, code-named Twiggy, that could read and write onto\nthose  thin,  delicate  5¼-inch  floppy  disks  that  older  readers  (who  also  remember\nTwiggy the model) will recall. But by the time the Lisa was ready to ship in the spring\nof 1983, it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy. Because the Lisa also came with a\nhard-disk drive, this was not a complete disaster. But the Mac had no hard disk, so it\nfaced a crisis. “The Mac team was beginning to panic,” said Hertzfeld. “We were using\na single Twiggy drive, and we didn’t have a hard disk to fall back on.”\nThe team discussed the problem at the January 1983 retreat, and Debi Coleman gave\nJobs data about the Twiggy failure rate. A few days later he drove to Apple’s factory in\nSan Jose to see the Twiggy being made. More than half were rejected. Jobs erupted.\nWith  his  face  flushed,  he  began  shouting  and  sputtering  about  firing  everyone  who\nworked there. Bob Belleville, the head of the Mac engineering team, gently guided him\nto the parking lot, where they could take a walk and talk about alternatives.\nOne possibility that Belleville had been exploring was to use a new 3½inch disk\ndrive that Sony had developed. The disk was cased in sturdier plastic and could fit into\na  shirt  pocket.  Another  option  was  to  have  a  clone  of  Sony’s  3½-inch  disk  drive\nmanufactured by a smaller Japanese supplier, the Alps Electronics Co., which had been\nsupplying disk drives for the Apple II. Alps had already licensed the technology from\nSony, and if they could build their own version in time it would be much cheaper.\nJobs and Belleville, along with Apple veteran Rod Holt (the guy Jobs enlisted to\ndesign the first power supply for the Apple II), flew to Japan to figure out what to do.\nThey took the bullet train from Tokyo to visit the Alps facility. The engineers there\ndidn’t even have a working prototype, just a crude model. Jobs thought it was great, but\nBelleville was appalled. There was no way, he thought, that Alps could have it ready\nfor the Mac within a year.\nAs  they  proceeded  to  visit  other  Japanese  companies,  Jobs  was  on  his  worst\nbehavior. He wore jeans and sneakers to meetings with Japanese managers in dark suits.\nWhen they formally handed him little gifts, as was the custom, he often left them behind,\nand  he  never  reciprocated  with  gifts  of  his  own.  He  would  sneer  when  rows  of\nengineers lined up to greet him, bow, and politely offer their products for inspection.\nJobs hated both the devices and the obsequiousness. “What are you showing me this\nfor?” he snapped at one stop. “This is a piece of crap! Anybody could build a better\ndrive than this.” Although most of his hosts were appalled, some seemed amused. They\nhad heard tales of his obnoxious style and brash behavior, and now they were getting to\nsee it in full display.\nThe final stop was the Sony factory, located in a drab suburb of Tokyo. To Jobs, it\nlooked messy and inelegant. A lot of the work was done by hand. He hated it. Back at\nthe hotel, Belleville argued for going with the Sony disk drive. It was ready to use. Jobs\n\ndisagreed. He decided that they would work with Alps to produce their own drive, and\nhe ordered Belleville to cease all work with Sony.\nBelleville  decided  it  was  best  to  partially  ignore  Jobs,  and  he  asked  a  Sony\nexecutive to get its disk drive ready for use in the Macintosh. If and when it became\nclear that Alps could not deliver on time, Apple would switch to Sony. So Sony sent\nover the engineer who had developed the drive, Hidetoshi Komoto, a Purdue graduate\nwho fortunately possessed a good sense of humor about his clandestine task.\nWhenever  Jobs  would  come  from  his  corporate  office  to  visit  the  Mac  team’s\nengineers—which was almost every afternoon—they would hurriedly find somewhere\nfor Komoto to hide. At one point Jobs ran into him at a newsstand in Cupertino and\nrecognized him from the meeting in Japan, but he didn’t suspect anything. The closest\ncall was when Jobs came bustling onto the Mac work space unexpectedly one day while\nKomoto was sitting in one of the cubicles. A Mac engineer grabbed him and pointed\nhim to a janitorial closet. “Quick, hide in this closet. Please! Now!” Komoto looked\nconfused, Hertzfeld recalled, but he jumped up and did as told. He had to stay in the\ncloset for five minutes, until Jobs left. The Mac engineers apologized. “No problem,”\nhe replied. “But American business practices, they are very strange. Very strange.”\nBelleville’s prediction came true. In May 1983 the folks at Alps admitted it would\ntake  them  at  least  eighteen  more  months  to  get  their  clone  of  the  Sony  drive  into\nproduction. At a retreat in Pajaro Dunes, Markkula grilled Jobs on what he was going to\ndo. Finally, Belleville interrupted and said that he might have an alternative to the Alps\ndrive ready soon. Jobs looked baffled for just a moment, and then it became clear to him\nwhy he’d glimpsed Sony’s top disk designer in Cupertino. “You son of a bitch!” Jobs\nsaid. But it was not in anger. There was a big grin on his face. As soon as he realized\nwhat  Belleville  and  the  other  engineers  had  done  behind  his  back,  said  Hertzfeld,\n“Steve swallowed his pride and thanked them for disobeying him and doing the right\nthing.” It was, after all, what he would have done in their situation.\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nENTER SCULLEY\nThe Pepsi Challenge\nWith John Sculley, 1984\nThe Courtship\nMike Markkula had never wanted to be Apple’s president. He liked designing his new\nhouses, flying his private plane, and living high off his stock options; he did not relish\nadjudicating conflict or curating high-maintenance egos. He had stepped into the role\nreluctantly, after he felt compelled to ease out Mike Scott, and he promised his wife the\ngig would be temporary. By the end of 1982, after almost two years, she gave him an\norder: Find a replacement right away.\nJobs knew that he was not ready to run the company himself, even though there was a\npart of him that wanted to try. Despite his arrogance, he could be self-aware. Markkula\nagreed; he told Jobs that he was still a bit too rough-edged and immature to be Apple’s\npresident. So they launched a search for someone from the outside.\n\nThe person they most wanted was Don Estridge, who had built IBM’s personal\ncomputer division from scratch and launched a PC that, even though Jobs and his team\ndisparaged it, was now outselling Apple’s. Estridge had sheltered his division in Boca\nRaton, Florida, safely removed from the corporate mentality of Armonk, New York.\nLike Jobs, he was driven and inspiring, but unlike Jobs, he had the ability to allow\nothers to think that his brilliant ideas were their own. Jobs flew to Boca Raton with the\noffer of a $1 million salary and a $1 million signing bonus, but Estridge turned him\ndown. He was not the type who would jump ship to join the enemy. He also enjoyed\nbeing part of the establishment, a member of the Navy rather than a pirate. He was\ndiscomforted by Jobs’s tales of ripping off the phone company. When asked where he\nworked, he loved to be able to answer “IBM.”\nSo Jobs and Markkula enlisted Gerry Roche, a gregarious corporate headhunter, to\nfind  someone  else.  They  decided  not  to  focus  on  technology  executives;  what  they\nneeded was a consumer marketer who knew advertising and had the corporate polish\nthat  would  play  well  on  Wall  Street.  Roche  set  his  sights  on  the  hottest  consumer\nmarketing wizard of the moment, John Sculley, president of the Pepsi-Cola division of\nPepsiCo,  whose  Pepsi  Challenge  campaign  had  been  an  advertising  and  publicity\ntriumph. When Jobs gave a talk to Stanford business students, he heard good things\nabout Sculley, who had spoken to the class earlier. So he told Roche he would be happy\nto meet him.\nSculley’s background was very different from Jobs’s. His mother was an Upper East\nSide Manhattan matron who wore white gloves when she went out, and his father was a\nproper Wall Street lawyer. Sculley was sent off to St. Mark’s School, then got his\nundergraduate degree from Brown and a business degree from Wharton. He had risen\nthrough  the  ranks  at  PepsiCo  as  an  innovative  marketer  and  advertiser,  with  little\npassion for product development or information technology.\nSculley flew to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his two teenage children from\na previous marriage. He took them to visit a computer store, where he was struck by\nhow poorly the products were marketed. When his kids asked why he was so interested,\nhe said he was planning to go up to Cupertino to meet Steve Jobs. They were totally\nblown away. They had grown up among movie stars, but to them Jobs was a true\ncelebrity. It made Sculley take more seriously the prospect of being hired as his boss.\nWhen he arrived at Apple headquarters, Sculley was startled by the unassuming\noffices  and  casual  atmosphere.  “Most  people  were  less  formally  dressed  than\nPepsiCo’s maintenance staff,” he noted. Over lunch Jobs picked quietly at his salad, but\nwhen Sculley declared that most executives found computers more trouble than they\nwere worth, Jobs clicked into evangelical mode. “We want to change the way people\nuse computers,” he said.\nOn the flight home Sculley outlined his thoughts. The result was an eight-page memo\non marketing computers to consumers and business executives. It was a bit sophomoric\nin  parts,  filled  with  underlined  phrases,  diagrams,  and  boxes,  but  it  revealed  his\n\nnewfound enthusiasm for figuring out ways to sell something more interesting than soda.\nAmong  his  recommendations:  “Invest  in  in-store  merchandizing  that romances  the\nconsumer with Apple’s potential to enrich their life!” He was still reluctant to leave\nPepsi, but Jobs intrigued him. “I was taken by this young, impetuous genius and thought\nit would be fun to get to know him a little better,” he recalled.\nSo Sculley agreed to meet again when Jobs next came to New York, which happened\nto be for the January 1983 Lisa introduction at the Carlyle Hotel. After the full day of\npress sessions, the Apple team was surprised to see an unscheduled visitor come into\nthe suite. Jobs loosened his tie and introduced Sculley as the president of Pepsi and a\npotential big corporate customer. As John Couch demonstrated the Lisa, Jobs chimed in\nwith  bursts  of  commentary,  sprinkled  with  his  favorite  words,  “revolutionary”  and\n“incredible,” claiming it would change the nature of human interaction with computers.\nThey then headed off to the Four Seasons restaurant, a shimmering haven of elegance\nand power. As Jobs ate a special vegan meal, Sculley described Pepsi’s marketing\nsuccesses. The Pepsi Generation campaign, he said, sold not a product but a lifestyle\nand an optimistic outlook. “I think Apple’s got a chance to create an Apple Generation.”\nJobs enthusiastically agreed. The Pepsi Challenge campaign, in contrast, focused on the\nproduct; it combined ads, events, and public relations to stir up buzz. The ability to turn\nthe introduction of a new product into a moment of national excitement was, Jobs noted,\nwhat he and Regis McKenna wanted to do at Apple.\nWhen they finished talking, it was close to midnight. “This has been one of the most\nexciting evenings in my whole life,” Jobs said as Sculley walked him back to the\nCarlyle.  “I  can’t  tell  you  how  much  fun  I’ve  had.”  When  he  finally  got  home  to\nGreenwich, Connecticut, that night, Sculley had trouble sleeping. Engaging with Jobs\nwas a lot more fun than negotiating with bottlers. “It stimulated me, roused my long-held\ndesire to be an architect of ideas,” he later noted. The next morning Roche called\nSculley. “I don’t know what you guys did last night, but let me tell you, Steve Jobs is\necstatic,” he said.\nAnd so the courtship continued, with Sculley playing hard but not impossible to get.\nJobs flew east for a visit one Saturday in February and took a limo up to Greenwich. He\nfound Sculley’s newly built mansion ostentatious, with its floor-to-ceiling windows, but\nhe admired the three hundred-pound custom-made oak doors that were so carefully hung\nand balanced that they swung open with the touch of a finger. “Steve was fascinated by\nthat because he is, as I am, a perfectionist,” Sculley recalled. Thus began the somewhat\nunhealthy process of a star-struck Sculley perceiving in Jobs qualities that he fancied in\nhimself.\nSculley usually drove a Cadillac, but, sensing his guest’s taste, he borrowed his\nwife’s Mercedes 450SL convertible to take Jobs to see Pepsi’s 144-acre corporate\nheadquarters, which was as lavish as Apple’s was austere. To Jobs, it epitomized the\ndifference  between  the  feisty  new  digital  economy  and  the  Fortune  500  corporate\nestablishment. A winding drive led through manicured fields and a sculpture garden\n\n(including pieces by Rodin, Moore, Calder, and Giacometti) to a concrete-and-glass\nbuilding designed by Edward Durell Stone. Sculley’s huge office had a Persian rug,\nnine windows, a small private garden, a hideaway study, and its own bathroom. When\nJobs saw the corporate fitness center, he was astonished that executives had an area,\nwith its own whirlpool, separate from that of the regular employees. “That’s weird,” he\nsaid. Sculley hastened to agree. “As a matter of fact, I was against it, and I go over and\nwork out sometimes in the employees’ area,” he said.\nTheir next meeting was a few weeks later in Cupertino, when Sculley stopped on his\nway back from a Pepsi bottlers’ convention in Hawaii. Mike Murray, the Macintosh\nmarketing manager, took charge of preparing the team for the visit, but he was not clued\nin on the real agenda. “PepsiCo could end up purchasing literally thousands of Macs\nover the next few years,” he exulted in a memo to the Macintosh staff. “During the past\nyear,  Mr. Sculley  and  a  certain  Mr.  Jobs  have  become  friends.  Mr.  Sculley  is\nconsidered to be one of the best marketing heads in the big leagues; as such, let’s give\nhim a good time here.”\nJobs wanted Sculley to share his excitement about the Macintosh. “This product\nmeans more to me than anything I’ve done,” he said. “I want you to be the first person\noutside of Apple to see it.” He dramatically pulled the prototype out of a vinyl bag and\ngave a demonstration. Sculley found Jobs as memorable as his machine. “He seemed\nmore a showman than a businessman. Every move seemed calculated, as if it was\nrehearsed, to create an occasion of the moment.”\nJobs  had  asked  Hertzfeld  and  the  gang  to  prepare  a  special  screen  display  for\nSculley’s amusement. “He’s really smart,” Jobs said. “You wouldn’t believe how smart\nhe is.” The explanation that Sculley might buy a lot of Macintoshes for Pepsi “sounded a\nlittle bit fishy to me,” Hertzfeld recalled, but he and Susan Kare created a screen of\nPepsi caps and cans that danced around with the Apple logo. Hertzfeld was so excited\nhe began waving his arms around during the demo, but Sculley seemed underwhelmed.\n“He asked a few questions, but he didn’t seem all that interested,” Hertzfeld recalled.\nHe never ended up warming to Sculley. “He was incredibly phony, a complete poseur,”\nhe later said. “He pretended to be interested in technology, but he wasn’t. He was a\nmarketing guy, and that is what marketing guys are: paid poseurs.”\nMatters came to a head when Jobs visited New York in March 1983 and was able to\nconvert the courtship into a blind and blinding romance. “I really think you’re the guy,”\nJobs said as they walked through Central Park. “I want you to come and work with me. I\ncan learn so much from you.” Jobs, who had cultivated father figures in the past, knew\njust how to play to Sculley’s ego and insecurities. It worked. “I was smitten by him,”\nSculley later admitted. “Steve was one of the brightest people I’d ever met. I shared\nwith him a passion for ideas.”\nSculley, who was interested in art history, steered them toward the Metropolitan\nMuseum for a little test of whether Jobs was really willing to learn from others. “I\nwanted  to  see  how  well  he  could  take  coaching  in  a  subject  where  he  had  no\n\nbackground,” he recalled. As they strolled through the Greek and Roman antiquities,\nSculley expounded on the difference between the Archaic sculpture of the sixth century\nB.C. and the Periclean sculptures a century later. Jobs, who loved to pick up historical\nnuggets he never learned in college, seemed to soak it in. “I gained a sense that I could\nbe a teacher to a brilliant student,” Sculley recalled. Once again he indulged the conceit\nthat they were alike: “I saw in him a mirror image of my younger self. I, too, was\nimpatient, stubborn, arrogant, impetuous. My mind exploded with ideas, often to the\nexclusion of everything else. I, too, was intolerant of those who couldn’t live up to my\ndemands.”\nAs they continued their long walk, Sculley confided that on vacations he went to the\nLeft Bank in Paris to draw in his sketchbook; if he hadn’t become a businessman, he\nwould be an artist. Jobs replied that if he weren’t working with computers, he could see\nhimself as a poet in Paris. They continued down Broadway to Colony Records on\nForty-ninth Street, where Jobs showed Sculley the music he liked, including Bob Dylan,\nJoan Baez, Ella Fitzgerald, and the Windham Hill jazz artists. Then they walked all the\nway back up to the San Remo on Central Park West and Seventy-fourth, where Jobs was\nplanning to buy a two-story tower penthouse apartment.\nThe  consummation  occurred  outside  the  penthouse  on  one  of  the  terraces,  with\nSculley sticking close to the wall because he was afraid of heights. First they discussed\nmoney. “I told him I needed $1 million in salary, $1 million for a sign-up bonus,” said\nSculley. Jobs claimed that would be doable. “Even if I have to pay for it out of my own\npocket,” he said. “We’ll have to solve those problems, because you’re the best person\nI’ve ever met. I know you’re perfect for Apple, and Apple deserves the best.” He added\nthat never before had he worked for someone he really respected, but he knew that\nSculley was the person who could teach him the most. Jobs gave him his unblinking\nstare.\nSculley uttered one last demurral, a token suggestion that maybe they should just be\nfriends and he could offer Jobs advice from the sidelines. “Any time you’re in New\nYork,  I’d  love  to  spend  time  with  you.”  He  later  recounted  the  climactic  moment:\n“Steve’s head dropped as he stared at his feet. After a weighty, uncomfortable pause, he\nissued a challenge that would haunt me for days. ‘Do you want to spend the rest of your\nlife selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?’”\nSculley  felt  as  if  he  had  been  punched  in  the  stomach.  There  was  no  response\npossible other than to acquiesce. “He had an uncanny ability to always get what he\nwanted, to size up a person and know exactly what to say to reach a person,” Sculley\nrecalled. “I realized for the first time in four months that I couldn’t say no.” The winter\nsun was beginning to set. They left the apartment and walked back across the park to the\nCarlyle.\n\nThe Honeymoon\nSculley arrived in California just in time for the May 1983 Apple management retreat at\nPajaro Dunes. Even though he had left all but one of his dark suits back in Greenwich,\nhe was still having trouble adjusting to the casual atmosphere. In the front of the meeting\nroom, Jobs sat on the floor in the lotus position absentmindedly playing with the toes of\nhis  bare  feet.  Sculley  tried  to  impose  an  agenda;  he  wanted  to  discuss  how  to\ndifferentiate their products—the Apple II, Apple III, Lisa, and Mac—and whether it\nmade sense to organize the company around product lines or markets or functions. But\nthe discussion descended into a free-for-all of random ideas, complaints, and debates.\nAt one point Jobs attacked the Lisa team for producing an unsuccessful product.\n“Well,” someone shot back, “you haven’t delivered the Macintosh! Why don’t you wait\nuntil you get a product out before you start being critical?” Sculley was astonished. At\nPepsi no one would have challenged the chairman like that. “Yet here, everyone began\npig-piling on Steve.” It reminded him of an old joke he had heard from one of the Apple\nad salesmen: “What’s the difference between Apple and the Boy Scouts? The Boy\nScouts have adult supervision.”\nIn the midst of the bickering, a small earthquake began to rumble the room. “Head\nfor the beach,” someone shouted. Everyone ran through the door to the water. Then\nsomeone else shouted that the previous earthquake had produced a tidal wave, so they\nall turned and ran the other way. “The indecision, the contradictory advice, the specter\nof natural disaster, only foreshadowed what was to come,” Sculley later wrote.\nOne Saturday morning Jobs invited Sculley and his wife, Leezy, over for breakfast.\nHe was then living in a nice but unexceptional Tudor-style home in Los Gatos with his\ngirlfriend,  Barbara  Jasinski,  a  smart  and  reserved  beauty  who  worked  for  Regis\nMcKenna. Leezy had brought a pan and made vegetarian omelets. (Jobs had edged away\nfrom his strict vegan diet for the time being.) “I’m sorry I don’t have much furniture,”\nJobs apologized. “I just haven’t gotten around to it.” It was one of his enduring quirks:\nHis  exacting  standards  of  craftsmanship  combined  with  a  Spartan  streak  made  him\nreluctant to buy any furnishings that he wasn’t passionate about. He had a Tiffany lamp,\nan antique dining table, and a laser disc video attached to a Sony Trinitron, but foam\ncushions on the floor rather than sofas and chairs. Sculley smiled and mistakenly thought\nthat it was similar to his own “frantic and Spartan life in a cluttered New York City\napartment” early in his own career.\nJobs confided in Sculley that he believed he would die young, and therefore he\nneeded to accomplish things quickly so that he would make his mark on Silicon Valley\nhistory. “We all have a short period of time on this earth,” he told the Sculleys as they\nsat around the table that morning. “We probably only have the opportunity to do a few\nthings really great and do them well. None of us has any idea how long we’re going to\n\nbe here, nor do I, but my feeling is I’ve got to accomplish a lot of these things while I’m\nyoung.”\nJobs and Sculley would talk dozens of times a day in the early months of their\nrelationship. “Steve and I became soul mates, near constant companions,” Sculley said.\n“We tended to speak in half sentences and phrases.” Jobs flattered Sculley. When he\ndropped by to hash something out, he would say something like “You’re the only one\nwho will understand.” They would tell each other repeatedly, indeed so often that it\nshould have been worrying, how happy they were to be with each other and working in\ntandem. And at every opportunity Sculley would find similarities with Jobs and point\nthem out:\nWe could complete each other’s sentences because we were on the same wavelength.\nSteve would rouse me from sleep at 2 a.m. with a phone call to chat about an idea that\nsuddenly crossed his mind. “Hi! It’s me,” he’d harmlessly say to the dazed listener,\ntotally unaware of the time. I curiously had done the same in my Pepsi days. Steve\nwould rip apart a presentation he had to give the next morning, throwing out slides and\ntext. So had I as I struggled to turn public speaking into an important management tool\nduring my early days at Pepsi. As a young executive, I was always impatient to get\nthings done and often felt I could do them better myself. So did Steve. Sometimes I felt\nas if I was watching Steve playing me in a movie. The similarities were uncanny, and\nthey were behind the amazing symbiosis we developed.\nThis was self-delusion, and it was a recipe for disaster. Jobs began to sense it early\non. “We had different ways of looking at the world, different views on people, different\nvalues,” Jobs recalled. “I began to realize this a few months after he arrived. He didn’t\nlearn things very quickly, and the people he wanted to promote were usually bozos.”\nYet Jobs knew that he could manipulate Sculley by encouraging his belief that they\nwere so alike. And the more he manipulated Sculley, the more contemptuous of him he\nbecame. Canny observers in the Mac group, such as Joanna Hoffman, soon realized\nwhat  was  happening  and  knew  that  it  would  make  the  inevitable  breakup  more\nexplosive. “Steve made Sculley feel like he was exceptional,” she said. “Sculley had\nnever felt that. Sculley became infatuated, because Steve projected on him a whole\nbunch of attributes that he didn’t really have. When it became clear that Sculley didn’t\nmatch all of these projections, Steve’s distortion of reality had created an explosive\nsituation.”\nThe ardor eventually began to cool on Sculley’s side as well. Part of his weakness\nin trying to manage a dysfunctional company was his desire to please other people, one\nof many traits that he did not share with Jobs. He was a polite person; this caused him to\nrecoil at Jobs’s rudeness to their fellow workers. “We would go to the Mac building at\n\neleven at night,” he recalled, “and they would bring him code to show. In some cases he\nwouldn’t even look at it. He would just take it and throw it back at them. I’d say, ‘How\ncan you turn it down?’ And he would say, ‘I know they can do better.’” Sculley tried to\ncoach him. “You’ve got to learn to hold things back,” he told him at one point. Jobs\nwould agree, but it was not in his nature to filter his feelings through a gauze.\nSculley began to believe that Jobs’s mercurial personality and erratic treatment of\npeople were rooted deep in his psychological makeup, perhaps the reflection of a mild\nbipolarity. There were big mood swings; sometimes he would be ecstatic, at other times\nhe was depressed. At times he would launch into brutal tirades without warning, and\nSculley would have to calm him down. “Twenty minutes later, I would get another call\nand be told to come over because Steve is losing it again,” he said.\nTheir first substantive disagreement was over how to price the Macintosh. It had\nbeen conceived as a $1,000 machine, but Jobs’s design changes had pushed up the cost\nso that the plan was to sell it at $1,995. However, when Jobs and Sculley began making\nplans for a huge launch and marketing push, Sculley decided that they needed to charge\n$500 more. To him, the marketing costs were like any other production cost and needed\nto be factored into the price. Jobs resisted, furiously. “It will destroy everything we\nstand for,” he said. “I want to make this a revolution, not an effort to squeeze out\nprofits.” Sculley said it was a simple choice: He could have the $1,995 price or he\ncould have the marketing budget for a big launch, but not both.\n“You’re not going to like this,” Jobs told Hertzfeld and the other engineers, “but\nSculley is insisting that we charge $2,495 for the Mac instead of $1,995.” Indeed the\nengineers were horrified. Hertzfeld pointed out that they were designing the Mac for\npeople like themselves, and overpricing it would be a “betrayal” of what they stood for.\nSo Jobs promised them, “Don’t worry, I’m not going to let him get away with it!” But in\nthe end, Sculley prevailed. Even twenty-five years later Jobs seethed when recalling the\ndecision:  “It’s  the  main  reason  the  Macintosh  sales  slowed  and  Microsoft  got  to\ndominate the market.” The decision made him feel that he was losing control of his\nproduct and company, and this was as dangerous as making a tiger feel cornered.\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nTHE LAUNCH\nA Dent in the Universe\nThe “1984” ad\nReal Artists Ship\nThe high point of the October 1983 Apple sales conference in Hawaii was a skit based\non a TV show called The Dating Game. Jobs played emcee, and his three contestants,\nwhom he had convinced to fly to Hawaii, were Bill Gates and two other software\nexecutives, Mitch Kapor and Fred Gibbons. As the show’s jingly theme song played, the\nthree took their stools. Gates, looking like a high school sophomore, got wild applause\nfrom the 750 Apple salesmen when he said, “During 1984, Microsoft expects to get half\nof its revenues from software for the Macintosh.” Jobs, clean-shaven and bouncy, gave\na toothy smile and asked if he thought that the Macintosh’s new operating system would\n\nbecome  one  of  the  industry’s  new  standards.  Gates  answered,  “To  create  a  new\nstandard takes not just making something that’s a little bit different, it takes something\nthat’s  really  new  and  captures  people’s  imagination.  And  the  Macintosh,  of  all  the\nmachines I’ve ever seen, is the only one that meets that standard.”\nBut even as Gates was speaking, Microsoft was edging away from being primarily a\ncollaborator with Apple to being more of a competitor. It would continue to make\napplication software, like Microsoft Word, for Apple, but a rapidly increasing share of\nits revenue would come from the operating system it had written for the IBM personal\ncomputer. The year before, 279,000 Apple IIs were sold, compared to 240,000 IBM\nPCs and its clones. But the figures for 1983 were coming in starkly different: 420,000\nApple IIs versus 1.3 million IBMs and its clones. And both the Apple III and the Lisa\nwere dead in the water.\nJust when the Apple sales force was arriving in Hawaii, this shift was hammered\nhome  on  the  cover  of Business  Week.  Its  headline:  “Personal  Computers:  And  the\nWinner Is ... IBM.” The story inside detailed the rise of the IBM PC. “The battle for\nmarket supremacy is already over,” the magazine declared. “In a stunning blitz, IBM has\ntaken more than 26% of the market in two years, and is expected to account for half the\nworld market by 1985. An additional 25% of the market will be turning out IBM-\ncompatible machines.”\nThat put all the more pressure on the Macintosh, due out in January 1984, three\nmonths away, to save the day against IBM. At the sales conference Jobs decided to play\nthe showdown to the hilt. He took the stage and chronicled all the missteps made by\nIBM since 1958, and then in ominous tones described how it was now trying to take\nover the market for personal computers: “Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer\nindustry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right about 1984?” At that\nmoment a screen came down from the ceiling and showed a preview of an upcoming\nsixty-second television ad for the Macintosh. In a few months it was destined to make\nadvertising  history,  but  in  the  meantime  it  served  its  purpose  of  rallying  Apple’s\ndemoralized  sales  force.  Jobs  had  always  been  able  to  draw  energy  by  imagining\nhimself as a rebel pitted against the forces of darkness. Now he was able to energize his\ntroops with the same vision.\nThere was one more hurdle: Hertzfeld and the other wizards had to finish writing the\ncode for the Macintosh. It was due to start shipping on Monday, January 16. One week\nbefore that, the engineers concluded they could not make that deadline.\nJobs was at the Grand Hyatt in Manhattan, preparing for the press previews, so a\nSunday  morning  conference  call  was  scheduled.  The  software  manager  calmly\nexplained  the  situation  to  Jobs,  while  Hertzfeld  and  the  others  huddled  around  the\nspeakerphone holding their breath. All they needed was an extra two weeks. The initial\nshipments to the dealers could have a version of the software labeled “demo,” and these\ncould be replaced as soon as the new code was finished at the end of the month. There\nwas a pause. Jobs did not get angry; instead he spoke in cold, somber tones. He told\n\nthem they were really great. So great, in fact, that he knew they could get this done.\n“There’s no way we’re slipping!” he declared. There was a collective gasp in the\nBandley building work space. “You guys have been working on this stuff for months\nnow, another couple weeks isn’t going to make that much of a difference. You may as\nwell get it over with. I’m going to ship the code a week from Monday, with your names\non it.”\n“Well, we’ve got to finish it,” Steve Capps said. And so they did. Once again, Jobs’s\nreality distortion field pushed them to do what they had thought impossible. On Friday\nRandy Wigginton brought in a huge bag of chocolate-covered espresso beans for the\nfinal three all-nighters. When Jobs arrived at work at 8:30 a.m. that Monday, he found\nHertzfeld sprawled nearly comatose on the couch. They talked for a few minutes about a\nremaining tiny glitch, and Jobs decreed that it wasn’t a problem. Hertzfeld dragged\nhimself to his blue Volkswagen Rabbit (license plate: MACWIZ) and drove home to\nbed. A short while later Apple’s Fremont factory began to roll out boxes emblazoned\nwith the colorful line drawings of the Macintosh. Real artists ship, Jobs had declared,\nand now the Macintosh team had.\nThe “1984” Ad\nIn the spring of 1983, when Jobs had begun to plan for the Macintosh launch, he asked\nfor a commercial that was as revolutionary and astonishing as the product they had\ncreated. “I want something that will stop people in their tracks,” he said. “I want a\nthunderclap.” The task fell to the Chiat/Day advertising agency, which had acquired the\nApple account when it bought the advertising side of Regis McKenna’s business. The\nperson put in charge was a lanky beach bum with a bushy beard, wild hair, goofy grin,\nand twinkling eyes named Lee Clow, who was the creative director of the agency’s\noffice in the Venice Beach section of Los Angeles. Clow was savvy and fun, in a laid-\nback yet focused way, and he forged a bond with Jobs that would last three decades.\nClow and two of his team, the copywriter Steve Hayden and the art director Brent\nThomas, had been toying with a tagline that played off the George Orwell novel: “Why\n1984 won’t be like 1984.” Jobs loved it, and asked them to develop it for the Macintosh\nlaunch. So they put together a storyboard for a sixty-second ad that would look like a\nscene  from  a  sci-fi  movie.  It  featured  a  rebellious  young  woman  outrunning  the\nOrwellian thought police and throwing a sledgehammer into a screen showing a mind-\ncontrolling speech by Big Brother.\nThe concept captured the zeitgeist of the personal computer revolution. Many young\npeople, especially those in the counterculture, had viewed computers as instruments that\ncould be used by Orwellian governments and giant corporations to sap individuality.\nBut by the end of the 1970s, they were also being seen as potential tools for personal\n\nempowerment.  The  ad  cast  Macintosh  as  a  warrior  for  the  latter  cause—a  cool,\nrebellious, and heroic company that was the only thing standing in the way of the big\nevil corporation’s plan for world domination and total mind control.\nJobs liked that. Indeed the concept for the ad had a special resonance for him. He\nfancied himself a rebel, and he liked to associate himself with the values of the ragtag\nband of hackers and pirates he recruited to the Macintosh group. Even though he had left\nthe apple commune in Oregon to start the Apple corporation, he still wanted to be\nviewed as a denizen of the counterculture rather than the corporate culture.\nBut he also realized, deep inside, that he had increasingly abandoned the hacker\nspirit. Some might even accuse him of selling out. When Wozniak held true to the\nHomebrew ethic by sharing his design for the Apple I for free, it was Jobs who insisted\nthat  they  sell  the  boards  instead.  He  was  also  the  one  who,  despite  Wozniak’s\nreluctance,  wanted  to  turn  Apple  into  a  corporation  and  not  freely  distribute  stock\noptions to the friends who had been in the garage with them. Now he was about to\nlaunch the Macintosh, a machine that violated many of the principles of the hacker’s\ncode: It was overpriced; it would have no slots, which meant that hobbyists could not\nplug in their own expansion cards or jack into the motherboard to add their own new\nfunctions; and it took special tools just to open the plastic case. It was a closed and\ncontrolled system, like something designed by Big Brother rather than by a hacker.\nSo the “1984” ad was a way of reaffirming, to himself and to the world, his desired\nself-image. The heroine, with a drawing of a Macintosh emblazoned on her pure white\ntank top, was a renegade out to foil the establishment. By hiring Ridley Scott, fresh off\nthe success of Blade Runner, as the director, Jobs could attach himself and Apple to the\ncyberpunk ethos of the time. With the ad, Apple could identify itself with the rebels and\nhackers who thought differently, and Jobs could reclaim his right to identify with them\nas well.\nSculley was initially skeptical when he saw the storyboards, but Jobs insisted that\nthey needed something revolutionary. He was able to get an unprecedented budget of\n$750,000 just to film the ad, which they planned to premiere during the Super Bowl.\nRidley Scott made it in London using dozens of real skinheads among the enthralled\nmasses listening to Big Brother on the screen. A female discus thrower was chosen to\nplay the heroine. Using a cold industrial setting dominated by metallic gray hues, Scott\nevoked the dystopian aura of Blade  Runner. Just at the moment when Big Brother\nannounces  “We  shall  prevail!”  the  heroine’s  hammer  smashes  the  screen  and  it\nvaporizes in a flash of light and smoke.\nWhen Jobs previewed the ad for the Apple sales force at the meeting in Hawaii, they\nwere thrilled. So he screened it for the board at its December 1983 meeting. When the\nlights came back on in the boardroom, everyone was mute. Philip Schlein, the CEO of\nMacy’s California, had his head on the table. Mike Markkula stared silently; at first it\nseemed he was overwhelmed by the power of the ad. Then he spoke: “Who wants to\nmove to find a new agency?” Sculley recalled, “Most of them thought it was the worst\n\ncommercial they had ever seen.” Sculley himself got cold feet. He asked Chiat/Day to\nsell off the two commercial spots—one sixty seconds, the other thirty—that they had\npurchased.\nJobs was beside himself. One evening Wozniak, who had been floating into and out\nof  Apple  for  the  previous  two  years,  wandered  into  the  Macintosh  building.  Jobs\ngrabbed him and said, “Come over here and look at this.” He pulled out a VCR and\nplayed the ad. “I was astounded,” Woz recalled. “I thought it was the most incredible\nthing.” When Jobs said the board had decided not to run it during the Super Bowl,\nWozniak asked what the cost of the time slot was. Jobs told him $800,000. With his\nusual impulsive goodness, Wozniak immediately offered, “Well, I’ll pay half if you\nwill.”\nHe ended up not needing to. The agency was able to sell off the thirty-second time\nslot, but in an act of passive defiance it didn’t sell the longer one. “We told them that we\ncouldn’t sell the sixty-second slot, though in truth we didn’t try,” recalled Lee Clow.\nSculley, perhaps to avoid a showdown with either the board or Jobs, decided to let Bill\nCampbell, the head of marketing, figure out what to do. Campbell, a former football\ncoach, decided to throw the long bomb. “I think we ought to go for it,” he told his team.\nEarly in the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII, the dominant Raiders scored a\ntouchdown against the Redskins and, instead of an instant replay, television screens\nacross the nation went black for an ominous two full seconds. Then an eerie black-and-\nwhite image of drones marching to spooky music began to fill the screen. More than\nninety-six million people watched an ad that was unlike any they’d seen before. At its\nend, as the drones watched in horror the vaporizing of Big Brother, an announcer calmly\nintoned, “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see\nwhy 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’”\nIt was a sensation. That evening all three networks and fifty local stations aired\nnews stories about the ad, giving it a viral life unprecedented in the pre–YouTube era. It\nwould eventually be selected by both TV Guide and Advertising Age as the greatest\ncommercial of all time.\nPublicity Blast\nOver the years Steve Jobs would become the grand master of product launches. In the\ncase of the Macintosh, the astonishing Ridley Scott ad was just one of the ingredients.\nAnother part of the recipe was media coverage. Jobs found ways to ignite blasts of\npublicity that were so powerful the frenzy would feed on itself, like a chain reaction. It\nwas a phenomenon that he would be able to replicate whenever there was a big product\nlaunch, from the Macintosh in 1984 to the iPad in 2010. Like a conjurer, he could pull\nthe trick off over and over again, even after journalists had seen it happen a dozen times\n\nand knew how it was done. Some of the moves he had learned from Regis McKenna,\nwho was a pro at cultivating and stroking prideful reporters. But Jobs had his own\nintuitive sense of how to stoke the excitement, manipulate the competitive instincts of\njournalists, and trade exclusive access for lavish treatment.\nIn December 1983 he took his elfin engineering wizards, Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell\nSmith, to New York to visit Newsweek to pitch a story on “the kids who created the\nMac.” After giving a demo of the Macintosh, they were taken upstairs to meet Katharine\nGraham, the legendary proprietor, who had an insatiable interest in whatever was new.\nAfterward the magazine sent its technology columnist and a photographer to spend time\nin Palo Alto with Hertzfeld and Smith. The result was a flattering and smart four-page\nprofile of the two of them, with pictures that made them look like cherubim of a new\nage. The article quoted Smith saying what he wanted to do next: “I want to build the\ncomputer of the 90’s. Only I want to do it tomorrow.” The article also described the mix\nof volatility and charisma displayed by his boss: “Jobs sometimes defends his ideas\nwith highly vocal displays of temper that aren’t always bluster; rumor has it that he has\nthreatened to fire employees for insisting that his computers should have cursor keys, a\nfeature that Jobs considers obsolete. But when he is on his best behavior, Jobs is a\ncurious blend of charm and impatience, oscillating between shrewd reserve and his\nfavorite expression of enthusiasm: ‘Insanely great.’”\nThe technology writer Steven Levy, who was then working for Rolling Stone, came\nto  interview  Jobs,  who  urged  him  to  convince  the  magazine’s  publisher  to  put  the\nMacintosh team on the cover of the magazine. “The chances of Jann Wenner agreeing to\ndisplace Sting in favor of a bunch of computer nerds were approximately one in a\ngoogolplex,” Levy thought, correctly. Jobs took Levy to a pizza joint and pressed the\ncase: Rolling Stone was “on the ropes, running crummy articles, looking desperately for\nnew topics and new audiences. The Mac could be its salvation!” Levy pushed back.\nRolling Stone was actually good, he said, and he asked Jobs if he had read it recently.\nJobs said that he had, an article about MTV that was “a piece of shit.” Levy replied that\nhe had written that article. Jobs, to his credit, didn’t back away from the assessment.\nInstead he turned philosophical as he talked about the Macintosh. We are constantly\nbenefiting from advances that went before us and taking things that people before us\ndeveloped, he said. “It’s a wonderful, ecstatic feeling to create something that puts it\nback in the pool of human experience and knowledge.”\nLevy’s story didn’t make it to the cover. But in the future, every major product launch\nthat Jobs was involved in—at NeXT, at Pixar, and years later when he returned to\nApple—would end up on the cover of either Time, Newsweek, or Business Week.\nJanuary 24, 1984\n\nOn the morning that he and his teammates completed the software for the Macintosh,\nAndy Hertzfeld had gone home exhausted and expected to stay in bed for at least a day.\nBut that afternoon, after only six hours of sleep, he drove back to the office. He wanted\nto check in to see if there had been any problems, and most of his colleagues had done\nthe same. They were lounging around, dazed but excited, when Jobs walked in. “Hey,\npick yourselves up off the floor, you’re not done yet!” he announced. “We need a demo\nfor the intro!” His plan was to dramatically unveil the Macintosh in front of a large\naudience and have it show off some of its features to the inspirational theme from\nChariots of Fire. “It needs to be done by the weekend, to be ready for the rehearsals,”\nhe added. They all groaned, Hertzfeld recalled, “but as we talked we realized that it\nwould be fun to cook up something impressive.”\nThe launch event was scheduled for the Apple annual stockholders’ meeting on\nJanuary 24—eight days away—at the Flint Auditorium of De Anza Community College.\nThe television ad and the frenzy of press preview stories were the first two components\nin what would become the Steve Jobs playbook for making the introduction of a new\nproduct seem like an epochal moment in world history. The third component was the\npublic  unveiling  of  the  product  itself,  amid  fanfare  and  flourishes,  in  front  of  an\naudience of adoring faithful mixed with journalists who were primed to be swept up in\nthe excitement.\nHertzfeld pulled off the remarkable feat of writing a music player in two days so that\nthe computer could play the Chariots of Fire theme. But when Jobs heard it, he judged\nit lousy, so they decided to use a recording instead. At the same time, Jobs was thrilled\nwith a speech generator that turned text into spoken words with a charming electronic\naccent, and he decided to make it part of the demo. “I want the Macintosh to be the first\ncomputer to introduce itself!” he insisted.\nAt the rehearsal the night before the launch, nothing was working well. Jobs hated\nthe way  the  animation  scrolled  across  the  Macintosh  screen,  and  he  kept  ordering\ntweaks. He also was dissatisfied with the stage lighting, and he directed Sculley to\nmove from seat to seat to give his opinion as various adjustments were made. Sculley\nhad never thought much about variations of stage lighting and gave the type of tentative\nanswers a patient might give an eye doctor when asked which lens made the letters\nclearer. The rehearsals and changes went on for five hours, well into the night. “He was\ndriving  people  insane,  getting  mad  at  the  stagehands  for  every  glitch  in  the\npresentation,” Sculley recalled. “I thought there was no way we were going to get it\ndone for the show the next morning.”\nMost of all, Jobs fretted about his presentation. Sculley fancied himself a good\nwriter, so he suggested changes in Jobs’s script. Jobs recalled being slightly annoyed,\nbut  their  relationship  was  still  in  the  phase  when  he  was  lathering  on  flattery  and\nstroking Sculley’s ego. “I think of you just like Woz and Markkula,” he told Sculley.\n“You’re like one of the founders of the company. They founded the company, but you and\nI are founding the future.” Sculley lapped it up.\n\nThe next morning the 2,600-seat auditorium was mobbed. Jobs arrived in a double-\nbreasted blue blazer, a starched white shirt, and a pale green bow tie. “This is the most\nimportant moment in my entire life,” he told Sculley as they waited backstage for the\nprogram to begin. “I’m really nervous. You’re probably the only person who knows\nhow I feel about this.” Sculley grasped his hand, held it for a moment, and whispered\n“Good luck.”\nAs  chairman  of  the  company,  Jobs  went  onstage  first  to  start  the  shareholders’\nmeeting. He did so with his own form of an invocation. “I’d like to open the meeting,”\nhe said, “with a twenty-year-old poem by Dylan—that’s Bob Dylan.” He broke into a\nlittle smile, then looked down to read from the second verse of “The Times They Are a-\nChangin’.” His voice was high-pitched as he raced through the ten lines, ending with\n“For the loser now / Will be later to win / For the times they are a-changin’.” That song\nwas  the  anthem  that  kept  the  multimillionaire  board  chairman  in  touch  with  his\ncounterculture self-image. He had a bootleg copy of his favorite version, which was\nfrom the live concert Dylan performed, with Joan Baez, on Halloween 1964 at Lincoln\nCenter’s Philharmonic Hall.\nSculley came onstage to report on the company’s earnings, and the audience started\nto become restless as he droned on. Finally, he ended with a personal note. “The most\nimportant thing that has happened to me in the last nine months at Apple has been a\nchance to develop a friendship with Steve Jobs,” he said. “For me, the rapport we have\ndeveloped means an awful lot.”\nThe lights dimmed as Jobs reappeared onstage and launched into a dramatic version\nof the battle cry he had delivered at the Hawaii sales conference. “It is 1958,” he began.\n“IBM passes up a chance to buy a young fledgling company that has invented a new\ntechnology called xerography. Two years later, Xerox was born, and IBM has been\nkicking themselves ever since.” The crowd laughed. Hertzfeld had heard versions of the\nspeech both in Hawaii and elsewhere, but he was struck by how this time it was pulsing\nwith more passion. After recounting other IBM missteps, Jobs picked up the pace and\nthe emotion as he built toward the present:\nIt is now 1984. It appears that IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope\nto offer IBM a run for its money. Dealers, after initially welcoming IBM with open\narms, now fear an IBM-dominated and -controlled future and are turning back to Apple\nas the only force who can ensure their future freedom. IBM wants it all, and is aiming\nits guns at its last obstacle to industry control, Apple. Will Big Blue dominate the entire\ncomputer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right?\nAs he built to the climax, the audience went from murmuring to applauding to a\nfrenzy of cheering and chanting. But before they could answer the Orwell question, the\n\nauditorium went black and the “1984” commercial appeared on the screen. When it was\nover, the entire audience was on its feet cheering.\nWith a flair for the dramatic, Jobs walked across the dark stage to a small table with\na cloth bag on it. “Now I’d like to show you Macintosh in person,” he said. He took out\nthe computer, keyboard, and mouse, hooked them together deftly, then pulled one of the\nnew 3½-inch floppies from his shirt pocket. The theme from Chariots of Fire began to\nplay. Jobs held his breath for a moment, because the demo had not worked well the\nnight  before.  But  this  time  it  ran  flawlessly.  The  word  “MACINTOSH”  scrolled\nhorizontally onscreen, then underneath it the words “Insanely great” appeared in script,\nas if being slowly written by hand. Not used to such beautiful graphic displays, the\naudience  quieted  for  a  moment. A  few  gasps  could  be  heard.  And  then,  in  rapid\nsuccession,  came  a  series  of  screen  shots:  Bill  Atkinson’s  QuickDraw  graphics\napplication  followed  by  displays  of  different  fonts,  documents,  charts,  drawings,  a\nchess  game,  a  spreadsheet,  and  a  rendering  of  Steve  Jobs  with  a  thought  bubble\ncontaining a Macintosh.\nWhen it was over, Jobs smiled and offered a treat. “We’ve done a lot of talking\nabout Macintosh recently,” he said. “But today, for the first time ever, I’d like to let\nMacintosh speak for itself.” With that, he strolled back over to the computer, pressed the\nbutton on the mouse, and in a vibrato but endearing electronic deep voice, Macintosh\nbecame the first computer to introduce itself. “Hello. I’m Macintosh. It sure is great to\nget out of that bag,” it began. The only thing it didn’t seem to know how to do was to\nwait for the wild cheering and shrieks that erupted. Instead of basking for a moment, it\nbarreled ahead. “Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I’d like to share with you a\nmaxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: Never trust a computer you\ncan’t lift.” Once again the roar almost drowned out its final lines. “Obviously, I can\ntalk. But right now I’d like to sit back and listen. So it is with considerable pride that I\nintroduce a man who’s been like a father to me, Steve Jobs.”\nPandemonium erupted, with people in the crowd jumping up and down and pumping\ntheir fists in a frenzy. Jobs nodded slowly, a tightlipped but broad smile on his face,\nthen looked down and started to choke up. The ovation continued for five minutes.\nAfter the Macintosh team returned to Bandley 3 that afternoon, a truck pulled into the\nparking  lot  and  Jobs  had  them  all  gather  next  to  it.  Inside  were  a  hundred  new\nMacintosh computers, each personalized with a plaque. “Steve presented them one at a\ntime to each team member, with a handshake and a smile, as the rest of us stood around\ncheering,” Hertzfeld recalled. It had been a grueling ride, and many egos had been\nbruised  by  Jobs’s  obnoxious  and  rough  management  style.  But  neither  Raskin  nor\nWozniak nor Sculley nor anyone else at the company could have pulled off the creation\nof the Macintosh. Nor would it likely have emerged from focus groups and committees.\nOn the day he unveiled the Macintosh, a reporter from Popular Science asked Jobs\nwhat type of market research he had done. Jobs responded by scoffing, “Did Alexander\nGraham Bell do any market research before he invented the telephone?”\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nGATES AND JOBS\nWhen Orbits Intersect\nJobs and Gates, 1991\nThe Macintosh Partnership\nIn astronomy, a binary system occurs when the orbits of two stars are linked because of\ntheir gravitational interaction. There have been analogous situations in history, when an\nera is shaped by the relationship and rivalry of two orbiting superstars: Albert Einstein\nand Niels Bohr in twentieth-century physics, for example, or Thomas Jefferson and\nAlexander Hamilton in early American governance. For the first thirty years of the\npersonal computer age, beginning in the late 1970s, the defining binary star system was\ncomposed of two high-energy college dropouts both born in 1955.\n\nBill  Gates  and Steve  Jobs,  despite  their  similar  ambitions  at  the  confluence  of\ntechnology  and  business,  had  very  different  personalities  and  backgrounds.  Gates’s\nfather  was  a  prominent  Seattle  lawyer,  his  mother  a  civic  leader  on  a  variety  of\nprestigious boards. He became a tech geek at the area’s finest private school, Lakeside\nHigh,  but  he  was  never  a  rebel,  hippie,  spiritual  seeker,  or  member  of  the\ncounterculture. Instead of a Blue Box to rip off the phone company, Gates created for his\nschool a program for scheduling classes, which helped him get into ones with the right\ngirls, and a car-counting program for local traffic engineers. He went to Harvard, and\nwhen he decided to drop out it was not to find enlightenment with an Indian guru but to\nstart a computer software company.\nGates was good at computer coding, unlike Jobs, and his mind was more practical,\ndisciplined, and abundant in analytic processing power. Jobs was more intuitive and\nromantic and had a greater instinct for making technology usable, design delightful, and\ninterfaces  friendly.  He  had  a  passion  for  perfection,  which  made  him  fiercely\ndemanding, and he managed by charisma and scattershot intensity. Gates was more\nmethodical; he held tightly scheduled product review meetings where he would cut to\nthe heart of issues with lapidary skill. Both could be rude, but with Gates—who early in\nhis career seemed to have a typical geek’s flirtation with the fringes of the Asperger’s\nscale—the  cutting  behavior  tended  to  be  less  personal,  based  more  on  intellectual\nincisiveness than emotional callousness. Jobs would stare at people with a burning,\nwounding  intensity;  Gates  sometimes  had  trouble  making  eye  contact,  but  he  was\nfundamentally humane.\n“Each one thought he was smarter than the other one, but Steve generally treated Bill\nas someone who was slightly inferior, especially in matters of taste and style,” said\nAndy Hertzfeld. “Bill looked down on Steve because he couldn’t actually program.”\nFrom the beginning of their relationship, Gates was fascinated by Jobs and slightly\nenvious of his mesmerizing effect on people. But he also found him “fundamentally odd”\nand “weirdly flawed as a human being,” and he was put off by Jobs’s rudeness and his\ntendency to be “either in the mode of saying you were shit or trying to seduce you.” For\nhis  part,  Jobs  found  Gates  unnervingly  narrow.  “He’d  be  a  broader  guy  if  he  had\ndropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger,” Jobs once declared.\nTheir differences in personality and character would lead them to opposite sides of\nwhat would become the fundamental divide in the digital age. Jobs was a perfectionist\nwho craved control and indulged in the uncompromising temperament of an artist; he\nand Apple became the exemplars of a digital strategy that tightly integrated hardware,\nsoftware, and content into a seamless package. Gates was a smart, calculating, and\npragmatic analyst of business and technology; he was open to licensing Microsoft’s\noperating system and software to a variety of manufacturers.\nAfter thirty years Gates would develop a grudging respect for Jobs. “He really never\nknew much about technology, but he had an amazing instinct for what works,” he said.\nBut  Jobs  never  reciprocated  by  fully  appreciating  Gates’s  real  strengths.  “Bill  is\n\nbasically unimaginative and has never invented anything, which is why I think he’s more\ncomfortable  now  in  philanthropy  than  technology,”  Jobs  said,  unfairly.  “He  just\nshamelessly ripped off other people’s ideas.”\nWhen the Macintosh was first being developed, Jobs went up to visit Gates at his office\nnear Seattle. Microsoft had written some applications for the Apple II, including a\nspreadsheet program called Multiplan, and Jobs wanted to excite Gates and Co. about\ndoing even more for the forthcoming Macintosh. Sitting in Gates’s conference room,\nJobs spun an enticing vision of a computer for the masses, with a friendly interface,\nwhich would be churned out by the millions in an automated California factory. His\ndescription  of  the  dream  factory  sucking  in  the  California  silicon  components  and\nturning out finished Macintoshes caused the Microsoft team to code-name the project\n“Sand.” They even reverse-engineered it into an acronym, for “Steve’s amazing new\ndevice.”\nGates  had  launched  Microsoft  by  writing  a  version  of  BASIC,  a  programming\nlanguage, for the Altair. Jobs wanted Microsoft to write a version of BASIC for the\nMacintosh, because Wozniak—despite much prodding by Jobs—had never enhanced his\nversion of the Apple II’s BASIC to handle floating-point numbers. In addition, Jobs\nwanted Microsoft to write application software—such as spreadsheet, charting, and\ndatabase programs—for the Macintosh. At the time, Jobs was a king and Gates still a\ncourtier: In 1982 Apple’s annual sales were $1 billion, while Microsoft’s were a mere\n$32 million. Gates signed on to do graphical versions of a new spreadsheet called\nExcel, a word-processing program called Word, and BASIC.\nGates frequently went to Cupertino for demonstrations of the Macintosh operating\nsystem, and he was not very impressed. “I remember the first time we went down, Steve\nhad this app where it was just things bouncing around on the screen,” he said. “That was\nthe only app that ran.” Gates was also put off by Jobs’s attitude. “It was kind of a weird\nseduction visit, where Steve was saying, ‘We don’t really need you and we’re doing\nthis great thing, and it’s under the cover.’ He’s in his Steve Jobs sales mode, but kind of\nthe sales mode that also says, ‘I don’t need you, but I might let you be involved.’”\nThe Macintosh pirates found Gates hard to take. “You could tell that Bill Gates was\nnot  a  very  good  listener.  He  couldn’t  bear  to  have  anyone  explain  how  something\nworked to him—he had to leap ahead instead and guess about how he thought it would\nwork,”  Hertzfeld  recalled.  They  showed  him  how  the  Macintosh’s  cursor  moved\nsmoothly across the screen without flickering. “What kind of hardware do you use to\ndraw the cursor?” Gates asked. Hertzfeld, who took great pride that they could achieve\ntheir functionality solely using software, replied, “We don’t have any special hardware\nfor it!” Gates insisted that it was necessary to have special hardware to move the cursor\nthat  way.  “So  what  do  you  say  to  somebody  like  that?”  Bruce  Horn,  one  of  the\n\nMacintosh engineers, later said. “It made it clear to me that Gates was not the kind of\nperson that would understand or appreciate the elegance of a Macintosh.”\nDespite  their  mutual  wariness,  both  teams  were  excited  by  the  prospect  that\nMicrosoft would create graphical software for the Macintosh that would take personal\ncomputing into a new realm, and they went to dinner at a fancy restaurant to celebrate.\nMicrosoft soon dedicated a large team to the task. “We had more people working on the\nMac than he did,” Gates said. “He had about fourteen or fifteen people. We had like\ntwenty people. We really bet our life on it.” And even though Jobs thought that they\ndidn’t exhibit much taste, the Microsoft programmers were persistent. “They came out\nwith applications that were terrible,” Jobs recalled, “but they kept at it and they made\nthem better.” Eventually Jobs became so enamored of Excel that he made a secret\nbargain with Gates: If Microsoft would make Excel exclusively for the Macintosh for\ntwo years, and not make a version for IBM PCs, then Jobs would shut down his team\nworking  on  a  version  of  BASIC  for  the  Macintosh  and  instead  indefinitely  license\nMicrosoft’s  BASIC.  Gates  smartly  took  the  deal,  which  infuriated  the  Apple  team\nwhose project got canceled and gave Microsoft a lever in future negotiations.\nFor the time being, Gates and Jobs forged a bond. That summer they went to a\nconference hosted by the industry analyst Ben Rosen at a Playboy Club retreat in Lake\nGeneva, Wisconsin, where nobody knew about the graphical interfaces that Apple was\ndeveloping. “Everybody was acting like the IBM PC was everything, which was nice,\nbut Steve and I were kind of smiling that, hey, we’ve got something,” Gates recalled.\n“And he’s kind of leaking, but nobody actually caught on.” Gates became a regular at\nApple retreats. “I went to every luau,” said Gates. “I was part of the crew.”\nGates enjoyed his frequent visits to Cupertino, where he got to watch Jobs interact\nerratically with his employees and display his obsessions. “Steve was in his ultimate\npied piper mode, proclaiming how the Mac will change the world and overworking\npeople  like  mad,  with  incredible  tensions  and  complex  personal  relationships.”\nSometimes Jobs would begin on a high, then lapse into sharing his fears with Gates.\n“We’d go down Friday night, have dinner, and Steve would just be promoting that\neverything is great. Then the second day, without fail, he’d be kind of, ‘Oh shit, is this\nthing going to sell, oh God, I have to raise the price, I’m sorry I did that to you, and my\nteam is a bunch of idiots.’”\nGates saw Jobs’s reality distortion field at play when the Xerox Star was launched.\nAt a joint team dinner one Friday night, Jobs asked Gates how many Stars had been sold\nthus far. Gates said six hundred. The next day, in front of Gates and the whole team,\nJobs said that three hundred Stars had been sold, forgetting that Gates had just told\neveryone it was actually six hundred. “So his whole team starts looking at me like, ‘Are\nyou going to tell him that he’s full of shit?’” Gates recalled. “And in that case I didn’t\ntake the bait.” On another occasion Jobs and his team were visiting Microsoft and\nhaving dinner at the Seattle Tennis Club. Jobs launched into a sermon about how the\nMacintosh and its software would be so easy to use that there would be no manuals. “It\n\nwas  like  anybody  who  ever  thought  that  there  would  be  a  manual  for  any  Mac\napplication was the greatest idiot,” said Gates. “And we were like, ‘Does he really\nmean it? Should we not tell him that we have people who are actually working on\nmanuals?’”\nAfter a while the relationship became bumpier. The original plan was to have some\nof the Microsoft applications—such as Excel, Chart, and File—carry the Apple logo\nand come bundled with the purchase of a Macintosh. “We were going to get $10 per\napp, per machine,” said Gates. But this arrangement upset competing software makers.\nIn addition, it seemed that some of Microsoft’s programs might be late. So Jobs invoked\na provision in his deal with Microsoft and decided not to bundle its software; Microsoft\nwould  have  to  scramble  to  distribute  its  software  as  products  sold  directly  to\nconsumers.\nGates went along without much complaint. He was already getting used to the fact\nthat, as he put it, Jobs could “play fast and loose,” and he suspected that the unbundling\nwould  actually  help  Microsoft.  “We  could  make  more  money  selling  our  software\nseparately,” Gates said. “It works better that way if you’re willing to think you’re going\nto have reasonable market share.” Microsoft ended up making its software for various\nother platforms, and it began to give priority to the IBM PC version of Microsoft Word\nrather than the Macintosh version. In the end, Jobs’s decision to back out of the bundling\ndeal hurt Apple more than it did Microsoft.\nWhen Excel for the Macintosh was released, Jobs and Gates unveiled it together at a\npress dinner at New York’s Tavern on the Green. Asked if Microsoft would make a\nversion of it for IBM PCs, Gates did not reveal the bargain he had made with Jobs but\nmerely answered that “in time” that might happen. Jobs took the microphone. “I’m sure\n‘in time’ we’ll all be dead,” he joked.\nThe Battle of the GUI\nAt that time, Microsoft was producing an operating system, known as DOS, which it\nlicensed to IBM and compatible computers. It was based on an old-fashioned command\nline interface that confronted users with surly little prompts such as C:\\>. As Jobs and\nhis team began to work closely with Microsoft, they grew worried that it would copy\nMacintosh’s  graphical  user  interface.  Andy  Hertzfeld  noticed  that  his  contact  at\nMicrosoft was asking detailed questions about how the Macintosh operating system\nworked. “I told Steve that I suspected that Microsoft was going to clone the Mac,” he\nrecalled.\nThey were right to worry. Gates believed that graphical interfaces were the future,\nand that Microsoft had just as much right as Apple did to copy what had been developed\n\nat Xerox PARC. As he freely admitted later, “We sort of say, ‘Hey, we believe in\ngraphics interfaces, we saw the Xerox Alto too.’”\nIn their original deal, Jobs had convinced Gates to agree that Microsoft would not\ncreate graphical software for anyone other than Apple until a year after the Macintosh\nshipped in January 1983. Unfortunately for Apple, it did not provide for the possibility\nthat the Macintosh launch would be delayed for a year. So Gates was within his rights\nwhen,  in  November  1983,  he  revealed  that  Microsoft  planned  to  develop  a  new\noperating system for IBM PCs featuring a graphical interface with windows, icons, and\na mouse for point-and-click navigation. It would be called Windows. Gates hosted a\nJobs-like product announcement, the most lavish thus far in Microsoft’s history, at the\nHelmsley Palace Hotel in New York.\nJobs was furious. He knew there was little he could do about it—Microsoft’s deal\nwith Apple not to do competing graphical software was running out—but he lashed out\nnonetheless. “Get Gates down here immediately,” he ordered Mike Boich, who was\nApple’s evangelist to other software companies. Gates arrived, alone and willing to\ndiscuss things with Jobs. “He called me down to get pissed off at me,” Gates recalled.\n“I went down to Cupertino, like a command performance. I told him, ‘We’re doing\nWindows.’ I said to him, ‘We’re betting our company on graphical interfaces.’”\nThey met in Jobs’s conference room, where Gates found himself surrounded by ten\nApple employees who were eager to watch their boss assail him. Jobs didn’t disappoint\nhis troops. “You’re ripping us off!” he shouted. “I trusted you, and now you’re stealing\nfrom us!” Hertzfeld recalled that Gates just sat there coolly, looking Steve in the eye,\nbefore hurling back, in his squeaky voice, what became a classic zinger. “Well, Steve, I\nthink there’s more than one way of looking at it. I think it’s more like we both had this\nrich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out\nthat you had already stolen it.”\nGates’s two-day visit provoked the full range of Jobs’s emotional responses and\nmanipulation techniques. It also made clear that the Apple-Microsoft symbiosis had\nbecome a scorpion dance, with both sides circling warily, knowing that a sting by either\ncould cause problems for both. After the confrontation in the conference room, Gates\nquietly gave Jobs a private demo of what was being planned for Windows. “Steve\ndidn’t know what to say,” Gates recalled. “He could either say, ‘Oh, this is a violation\nof something,’ but he didn’t. He chose to say, ‘Oh, it’s actually really a piece of shit.’”\nGates was thrilled, because it gave him a chance to calm Jobs down for a moment. “I\nsaid, ‘Yes, it’s a nice little piece of shit.’” So Jobs went through a gamut of other\nemotions. “During the course of this meeting, he’s just ruder than shit,” Gates said. “And\nthen there’s a part where he’s almost crying, like, ‘Oh, just give me a chance to get this\nthing off.’” Gates responded by becoming very calm. “I’m good at when people are\nemotional, I’m kind of less emotional.”\nAs he often did when he wanted to have a serious conversation, Jobs suggested they\ngo on a long walk. They trekked the streets of Cupertino, back and forth to De Anza\n\ncollege, stopping at a diner and then walking some more. “We had to take a walk, which\nis not one of my management techniques,” Gates said. “That was when he began saying\nthings like, ‘Okay, okay, but don’t make it too much like what we’re doing.’”\nAs it turned out, Microsoft wasn’t able to get Windows 1.0 ready for shipping until\nthe fall of 1985. Even then, it was a shoddy product. It lacked the elegance of the\nMacintosh  interface,  and  it  had  tiled  windows  rather  than  the  magical  clipping  of\noverlapping  windows  that  Bill  Atkinson  had  devised.  Reviewers  ridiculed  it  and\nconsumers  spurned  it.  Nevertheless,  as  is  often  the  case  with  Microsoft  products,\npersistence eventually made Windows better and then dominant.\nJobs never got over his anger. “They just ripped us off completely, because Gates\nhas  no  shame,”  Jobs  told  me  almost  thirty  years  later.  Upon  hearing  this,  Gates\nresponded,  “If  he  believes  that,  he  really  has  entered  into  one  of  his  own  reality\ndistortion fields.” In a legal sense, Gates was right, as courts over the years have\nsubsequently ruled. And on a practical level, he had a strong case as well. Even though\nApple made a deal for the right to use what it saw at Xerox PARC, it was inevitable that\nother companies would develop similar graphical interfaces. As Apple found out, the\n“look and feel” of a computer interface design is a hard thing to protect.\nAnd  yet  Jobs’s  dismay  was  understandable.  Apple  had  been  more  innovative,\nimaginative, elegant in execution, and brilliant in design. But even though Microsoft\ncreated  a  crudely  copied  series  of  products,  it  would  end  up  winning  the  war  of\noperating systems. This exposed an aesthetic flaw in how the universe worked: The best\nand most innovative products don’t always win. A decade later, this truism caused Jobs\nto let loose a rant that was somewhat arrogant and over-the-top, but also had a whiff of\ntruth to it. “The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste, they have\nabsolutely no taste,” he said. “I don’t mean that in a small way. I mean that in a big way,\nin the sense that they don’t think of original ideas and they don’t bring much culture into\ntheir product.”\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nICARUS\nWhat Goes Up ...\nFlying High\nThe launch of the Macintosh in January 1984 propelled Jobs into an even higher orbit of\ncelebrity, as was evident during a trip to Manhattan he took at the time. He went to a\nparty that Yoko Ono threw for her son, Sean Lennon, and gave the nine-year-old a\nMacintosh. The boy loved it. The artists Andy Warhol and Keith Haring were there, and\nthey  were  so  enthralled  by  what  they  could  create  with  the  machine  that  the\ncontemporary  art  world  almost  took  an  ominous  turn.  “I  drew  a  circle,”  Warhol\nexclaimed proudly after using MacPaint. Warhol insisted that Jobs take a computer to\nMick Jagger. When Jobs arrived at the rock star’s townhouse, Jagger seemed baffled.\nHe didn’t quite know who Jobs was. Later Jobs told his team, “I think he was on drugs.\nEither  that  or  he’s  brain-damaged.”  Jagger’s  daughter  Jade,  however,  took  to  the\ncomputer  immediately  and  started  drawing  with  MacPaint,  so  Jobs  gave  it  to  her\ninstead.\nHe bought the top-floor duplex apartment that he’d shown Sculley in the San Remo\non Manhattan’s Central Park West and hired James Freed of I. M. Pei’s firm to renovate\nit, but he never moved in. (He would later sell it to Bono for $15 million.) He also\nbought an old Spanish colonial-style fourteen-bedroom mansion in Woodside, in the\nhills above Palo Alto, that had been built by a copper baron, which he moved into but\nnever got around to furnishing.\nAt Apple his status revived. Instead of seeking ways to curtail Jobs’s authority,\nSculley gave him more: The Lisa and Macintosh divisions were folded together, with\nJobs in charge. He was flying high, but this did not serve to make him more mellow.\nIndeed there was a memorable display of his brutal honesty when he stood in front of\n\nthe combined Lisa and Macintosh teams to describe how they would be merged. His\nMacintosh group leaders would get all of the top positions, he said, and a quarter of the\nLisa staff would be laid off. “You guys failed,” he said, looking directly at those who\nhad worked on the Lisa. “You’re a B team. B players. Too many people here are B or C\nplayers, so today we are releasing some of you to have the opportunity to work at our\nsister companies here in the valley.”\nBill Atkinson, who had worked on both teams, thought it was not only callous, but\nunfair. “These people had worked really hard and were brilliant engineers,” he said.\nBut Jobs had latched onto what he believed was a key management lesson from his\nMacintosh experience: You have to be ruthless if you want to build a team of A players.\n“It’s too easy, as a team grows, to put up with a few B players, and they then attract a\nfew more B players, and soon you will even have some C players,” he recalled. “The\nMacintosh experience taught me that A players like to work only with other A players,\nwhich means you can’t indulge B players.”\nFor  the  time  being,  Jobs  and  Sculley  were  able  to  convince  themselves  that  their\nfriendship was still strong. They professed their fondness so effusively and often that\nthey  sounded  like  high  school  sweethearts  at  a  Hallmark  card  display.  The  first\nanniversary of Sculley’s arrival came in May 1984, and to celebrate Jobs lured him to a\ndinner  party  at  Le  Mouton  Noir,  an  elegant  restaurant  in  the  hills  southwest  of\nCupertino. To Sculley’s surprise, Jobs had gathered the Apple board, its top managers,\nand even some East Coast investors. As they all congratulated him during cocktails,\nSculley recalled, “a beaming Steve stood in the background, nodding his head up and\ndown and wearing a Cheshire Cat smile on his face.” Jobs began the dinner with a\nfulsome toast. “The happiest two days for me were when Macintosh shipped and when\nJohn Sculley agreed to join Apple,” he said. “This has been the greatest year I’ve ever\nhad in my whole life, because I’ve learned so much from John.” He then presented\nSculley with a montage of memorabilia from the year.\nIn response, Sculley effused about the joys of being Jobs’s partner for the past year,\nand he concluded with a line that, for different reasons, everyone at the table found\nmemorable. “Apple has one leader,” he said, “Steve and me.” He looked across the\nroom, caught Jobs’s eye, and watched him smile. “It was as if we were communicating\nwith each other,” Sculley recalled. But he also noticed that Arthur Rock and some of the\nothers were looking quizzical, perhaps even skeptical. They were worried that Jobs\nwas completely rolling him. They had hired Sculley to control Jobs, and now it was\nclear that Jobs was the one in control. “Sculley was so eager for Steve’s approval that\nhe was unable to stand up to him,” Rock recalled.\nKeeping Jobs happy and deferring to his expertise may have seemed like a smart\nstrategy to Sculley. But he failed to realize that it was not in Jobs’s nature to share\ncontrol. Deference did not come naturally to him. He began to become more vocal about\n\nhow he thought the company should be run. At the 1984 business strategy meeting, for\nexample, he pushed to make the company’s centralized sales and marketing staffs bid on\nthe right to provide their services to the various product divisions. (This would have\nmeant, for example, that the Macintosh group could decide not to use Apple’s marketing\nteam and instead create one of its own.) No one else was in favor, but Jobs kept trying\nto ram it through. “People were looking to me to take control, to get him to sit down and\nshut up, but I didn’t,” Sculley recalled. As the meeting broke up, he heard someone\nwhisper, “Why doesn’t Sculley shut him up?”\nWhen Jobs decided to build a state-of-the-art factory in Fremont to manufacture the\nMacintosh,  his  aesthetic  passions  and  controlling  nature  kicked  into  high  gear.  He\nwanted the machinery to be painted in bright hues, like the Apple logo, but he spent so\nmuch time going over paint chips that Apple’s manufacturing director, Matt Carter,\nfinally just installed them in their usual beige and gray. When Jobs took a tour, he\nordered that the machines be repainted in the bright colors he wanted. Carter objected;\nthis was precision equipment, and repainting the machines could cause problems. He\nturned out to be right. One of the most expensive machines, which got painted bright\nblue, ended up not working properly and was dubbed “Steve’s folly.” Finally Carter\nquit. “It took so much energy to fight him, and it was usually over something so pointless\nthat finally I had enough,” he recalled.\nJobs tapped as a replacement Debi Coleman, the spunky but good-natured Macintosh\nfinancial officer who had once won the team’s annual award for the person who best\nstood up to Jobs. But she knew how to cater to his whims when necessary. When\nApple’s art director, Clement Mok, informed her that Jobs wanted the walls to be pure\nwhite, she protested, “You can’t paint a factory pure white. There’s going to be dust and\nstuff all over.” Mok replied, “There’s no white that’s too white for Steve.” She ended\nup going along. With its pure white walls and its bright blue, yellow, and red machines,\nthe factory floor “looked like an Alexander Calder showcase,” said Coleman.\nWhen asked about his obsessive concern over the look of the factory, Jobs said it\nwas a way to ensure a passion for perfection:\nI’d go out to the factory, and I’d put on a white glove to check for dust. I’d find it\neverywhere—on machines, on the tops of the racks, on the floor. And I’d ask Debi to get\nit cleaned. I told her I thought we should be able to eat off the floor of the factory. Well,\nthis drove Debi up the wall. She didn’t understand why. And I couldn’t articulate it back\nthen. See, I’d been very influenced by what I’d seen in Japan. Part of what I greatly\nadmired there—and part of what we were lacking in our factory—was a sense of\nteamwork and discipline. If we didn’t have the discipline to keep that place spotless,\nthen we weren’t going to have the discipline to keep all these machines running.\n\nOne Sunday morning Jobs brought his father to see the factory. Paul Jobs had always\nbeen fastidious about making sure that his craftsmanship was exacting and his tools in\norder, and his son was proud to show that he could do the same. Coleman came along to\ngive the tour. “Steve was, like, beaming,” she recalled. “He was so proud to show his\nfather this creation.” Jobs explained how everything worked, and his father seemed\ntruly admiring. “He kept looking at his father, who touched everything and loved how\nclean and perfect everything looked.”\nThings were not quite as sweet when Danielle Mitterrand toured the factory. The\nCuba-admiring wife of France’s socialist president François Mitterrand asked a lot of\nquestions, through her translator, about the working conditions, while Jobs, who had\ngrabbed Alain Rossmann to serve as his translator, kept trying to explain the advanced\nrobotics and technology. After Jobs talked about the just-in-time production schedules,\nshe asked about overtime pay. He was annoyed, so he described how automation helped\nhim keep down labor costs, a subject he knew would not delight her. “Is it hard work?”\nshe asked. “How much vacation time do they get?” Jobs couldn’t contain himself. “If\nshe’s so interested in their welfare,” he said to her translator, “tell her she can come\nwork  here  any  time.”  The  translator  turned  pale  and  said  nothing.  After  a  moment\nRossmann stepped in to say, in French, “M. Jobs says he thanks you for your visit and\nyour interest in the factory.” Neither Jobs nor Madame Mitterrand knew what happened,\nRossmann recalled, but her translator looked very relieved.\nAfterward,  as  he  sped  his  Mercedes  down  the  freeway  toward  Cupertino,  Jobs\nfumed to Rossmann about Madame Mitterrand’s attitude. At one point he was going just\nover 100 miles per hour when a policeman stopped him and began writing a ticket.\nAfter a few minutes, as the officer scribbled away, Jobs honked. “Excuse me?” the\npoliceman said. Jobs replied, “I’m in a hurry.” Amazingly, the officer didn’t get mad.\nHe simply finished writing the ticket and warned that if Jobs was caught going over 55\nagain he would be sent to jail. As soon as the policeman left, Jobs got back on the road\nand accelerated to 100. “He absolutely believed that the normal rules didn’t apply to\nhim,” Rossmann marveled.\nHis  wife,  Joanna  Hoffman,  saw  the  same  thing  when  she  accompanied  Jobs  to\nEurope  a  few  months  after  the  Macintosh  was  launched.  “He  was  just  completely\nobnoxious and thinking he could get away with anything,” she recalled. In Paris she had\narranged a formal dinner with French software developers, but Jobs suddenly decided\nhe didn’t want to go. Instead he shut the car door on Hoffman and told her he was going\nto see the poster artist Folon instead. “The developers were so pissed off they wouldn’t\nshake our hands,” she said.\nIn Italy, he took an instant dislike to Apple’s general manager, a soft rotund guy who\nhad come from a conventional business. Jobs told him bluntly that he was not impressed\nwith his team or his sales strategy. “You don’t deserve to be able to sell the Mac,” Jobs\nsaid coldly. But that was mild compared to his reaction to the restaurant the hapless\nmanager had chosen. Jobs demanded a vegan meal, but the waiter very elaborately\n\nproceeded to dish out a sauce filled with sour cream. Jobs got so nasty that Hoffman had\nto threaten him. She whispered that if he didn’t calm down, she was going to pour her\nhot coffee on his lap.\nThe most substantive disagreements Jobs had on the European trip concerned sales\nforecasts. Using his reality distortion field, Jobs was always pushing his team to come\nup with higher projections. He kept threatening the European managers that he wouldn’t\ngive them any allocations unless they projected bigger forecasts. They insisted on being\nrealistic, and Hoffmann had to referee. “By the end of the trip, my whole body was\nshaking uncontrollably,” Hoffman recalled.\nIt was on this trip that Jobs first got to know Jean-Louis Gassée, Apple’s manager in\nFrance. Gassée was among the few to stand up successfully to Jobs on the trip. “He has\nhis own way with the truth,” Gassée later remarked. “The only way to deal with him\nwas to out-bully him.” When Jobs made his usual threat about cutting down on France’s\nallocations if Gassée didn’t jack up sales projections, Gassée got angry. “I remember\ngrabbing his lapel and telling him to stop, and then he backed down. I used to be an\nangry man myself. I am a recovering assaholic. So I could recognize that in Steve.”\nGassée was impressed, however, at how Jobs could turn on the charm when he\nwanted to. François Mitterrand had been preaching the gospel of informatique  pour\ntous—computing for all—and various academic experts in technology, such as Marvin\nMinsky and Nicholas Negroponte, came over to sing in the choir. Jobs gave a talk to the\ngroup at the Hotel Bristol and painted a picture of how France could move ahead if it\nput computers in all of its schools. Paris also brought out the romantic in him. Both\nGassée and Negroponte tell tales of him pining over women while there.\nFalling\nAfter the burst of excitement that accompanied the release of Macintosh, its sales began\nto taper off in the second half of 1984. The problem was a fundamental one: It was a\ndazzling but woefully slow and underpowered computer, and no amount of hoopla could\nmask that. Its beauty was that its user interface looked like a sunny playroom rather than\na somber dark screen with sickly green pulsating letters and surly command lines. But\nthat led to its greatest weakness: A character on a text-based display took less than a\nbyte of code, whereas when the Mac drew a letter, pixel by pixel in any elegant font you\nwanted,  it  required  twenty  or  thirty  times  more  memory.  The  Lisa  handled  this  by\nshipping with more than 1,000K RAM, whereas the Macintosh made do with 128K.\nAnother problem was the lack of an internal hard disk drive. Jobs had called Joanna\nHoffman a “Xerox bigot” when she fought for such a storage device. He insisted that the\nMacintosh have just one floppy disk drive. If you wanted to copy data, you could end up\nwith a new form of tennis elbow from having to swap floppy disks in and out of the\n\nsingle  drive.  In  addition,  the  Macintosh  lacked  a  fan,  another  example  of  Jobs’s\ndogmatic  stubbornness.  Fans,  he  felt,  detracted  from  the  calm  of  a  computer.  This\ncaused many component failures and earned the Macintosh the nickname “the beige\ntoaster,” which did not enhance its popularity. It was so seductive that it had sold well\nenough for the first few months, but when people became more aware of its limitations,\nsales fell. As Hoffman later lamented, “The reality distortion field can serve as a spur,\nbut then reality itself hits.”\nAt the end of 1984, with Lisa sales virtually nonexistent and Macintosh sales falling\nbelow  ten  thousand  a  month,  Jobs  made  a  shoddy,  and  atypical,  decision  out  of\ndesperation. He decided to take the inventory of unsold Lisas, graft on a Macintosh-\nemulation program, and sell them as a new product, the “Macintosh XL.” Since the Lisa\nhad been discontinued and would not be restarted, it was an unusual instance of Jobs\nproducing something that he did not believe in. “I was furious because the Mac XL\nwasn’t real,” said Hoffman. “It was just to blow the excess Lisas out the door. It sold\nwell, and then we had to discontinue the horrible hoax, so I resigned.”\nThe dark mood was evident in the ad that was developed in January 1985, which\nwas  supposed  to  reprise  the  anti-IBM  sentiment  of  the  resonant  “1984”  ad.\nUnfortunately there was a fundamental difference: The first ad had ended on a heroic,\noptimistic note, but the storyboards presented by Lee Clow and Jay Chiat for the new\nad, titled “Lemmings,” showed dark-suited, blindfolded corporate managers marching\noff a cliff to their death. From the beginning both Jobs and Sculley were uneasy. It didn’t\nseem as if it would convey a positive or glorious image of Apple, but instead would\nmerely insult every manager who had bought an IBM.\nJobs and Sculley asked for other ideas, but the agency folks pushed back. “You guys\ndidn’t want to run ‘1984’ last year,” one of them said. According to Sculley, Lee Clow\nadded, “I will put my whole reputation, everything, on this commercial.” When the\nfilmed version, done by Ridley Scott’s brother Tony, came in, the concept looked even\nworse.  The  mindless  managers  marching  off  the  cliff  were  singing  a  funeral-paced\nversion of the Snow White song “Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho,” and the dreary filmmaking made\nit even more depressing than the storyboards portended. “I can’t believe you’re going to\ninsult businesspeople across America by running that,” Debi Coleman yelled at Jobs\nwhen she saw the ad. At the marketing meetings, she stood up to make her point about\nhow much she hated it. “I literally put a resignation letter on his desk. I wrote it on my\nMac. I thought it was an affront to corporate managers. We were just beginning to get a\ntoehold with desktop publishing.”\nNevertheless  Jobs  and  Sculley  bent  to  the  agency’s  entreaties  and  ran  the\ncommercial during the Super Bowl. They went to the game together at Stanford Stadium\nwith Sculley’s wife, Leezy (who couldn’t stand Jobs), and Jobs’s new girlfriend, Tina\nRedse. When the commercial was shown near the end of the fourth quarter of a dreary\ngame, the fans watched on the overhead screen and had little reaction. Across the\ncountry, most of the response was negative. “It insulted the very people Apple was\n\ntrying  to  reach,”  the  president  of  a  market  research  firm  told Fortune.  Apple’s\nmarketing manager suggested afterward that the company might want to buy an ad in the\nWall Street Journal apologizing. Jay Chiat threatened that if Apple did that his agency\nwould buy the facing page and apologize for the apology.\nJobs’s discomfort, with both the ad and the situation at Apple in general, was on\ndisplay when he traveled to New York in January to do another round of one-on-one\npress interviews. Andy Cunningham, from Regis McKenna’s firm, was in charge of\nhand-holding and logistics at the Carlyle. When Jobs arrived, he told her that his suite\nneeded to be completely redone, even though it was 10 p.m. and the meetings were to\nbegin the next day. The piano was not in the right place; the strawberries were the\nwrong type. But his biggest objection was that he didn’t like the flowers. He wanted\ncalla lilies. “We got into a big fight on what a calla lily is,” Cunningham recalled. “I\nknow what they are, because I had them at my wedding, but he insisted on having a\ndifferent type of lily and said I was ‘stupid’ because I didn’t know what a real calla lily\nwas.” So Cunningham went out and, this being New York, was able to find a place open\nat midnight where she could get the lilies he wanted. By the time they got the room\nrearranged, Jobs started objecting to what she was wearing. “That suit’s disgusting,” he\ntold her. Cunningham knew that at times he just simmered with undirected anger, so she\ntried to calm him down. “Look, I know you’re angry, and I know how you feel,” she\nsaid.\n“You have no fucking idea how I feel,” he shot back, “no fucking idea what it’s like\nto be me.”\nThirty Years Old\nTurning thirty is a milestone for most people, especially those of the generation that\nproclaimed it would never trust anyone over that age. To celebrate his own thirtieth, in\nFebruary 1985, Jobs threw a lavishly formal but also playful—black tie and tennis\nshoes—party for one thousand in the ballroom of the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco.\nThe invitation read, “There’s an old Hindu saying that goes, ‘In the first 30 years of your\nlife, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.’\nCome help me celebrate mine.”\nOne table featured software moguls, including Bill Gates and Mitch Kapor. Another\nhad old friends such as Elizabeth Holmes, who brought as her date a woman dressed in\na tuxedo. Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell Smith had rented tuxes and wore floppy tennis\nshoes, which made it all the more memorable when they danced to the Strauss waltzes\nplayed by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.\nElla Fitzgerald provided the entertainment, as Bob Dylan had declined. She sang\nmainly from her standard repertoire, though occasionally tailoring a song like “The Girl\n\nfrom Ipanema” to be about the boy from Cupertino. When she asked for some requests,\nJobs called out a few. She concluded with a slow rendition of “Happy Birthday.”\nSculley came to the stage to propose a toast to “technology’s foremost visionary.”\nWozniak also came up and presented Jobs with a framed copy of the Zaltair hoax from\nthe 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, where the Apple II had been introduced. The\nventure capitalist Don Valentine marveled at the change in the decade since that time.\n“He went from being a Ho Chi Minh look-alike, who said never trust anyone over thirty,\nto a person who gives himself a fabulous thirtieth birthday with Ella Fitzgerald,” he\nsaid.\nMany people had picked out special gifts for a person who was not easy to shop for.\nDebi Coleman, for example, found a first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The  Last\nTycoon. But Jobs, in an act that was odd yet not out of character, left all of the gifts in a\nhotel room. Wozniak and some of the Apple veterans, who did not take to the goat\ncheese and salmon mousse that was served, met after the party and went out to eat at a\nDenny’s.\n“It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something\namazing,” Jobs said wistfully to the writer David Sheff, who published a long and\nintimate interview in Playboy the month he turned thirty. “Of course, there are some\npeople who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they’re\nrare.” The interview touched on many subjects, but Jobs’s most poignant ruminations\nwere about growing old and facing the future:\nYour thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching\nchemical patterns. In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in\na record, and they never get out of them.\nI’ll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I’ll sort of have\nthe thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a\ntapestry. There may be a few years when I’m not there, but I’ll always come back. ...\nIf you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back\ntoo much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were\nand throw them away.\nThe more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to\ncontinue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, “Bye. I have to\ngo. I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of here.” And they go and hibernate somewhere.\nMaybe later they re-emerge a little differently.\nWith each of those statements, Jobs seemed to have a premonition that his life would\nsoon be changing. Perhaps the thread of his life would indeed weave in and out of the\nthread of Apple’s. Perhaps it was time to throw away some of what he had been.\n\nPerhaps  it  was  time  to  say  “Bye,  I  have  to  go,”  and  then  reemerge  later,  thinking\ndifferently.\nExodus\nAndy Hertzfeld had taken a leave of absence after the Macintosh came out in 1984. He\nneeded to recharge his batteries and get away from his supervisor, Bob Belleville,\nwhom he didn’t like. One day he learned that Jobs had given out bonuses of up to\n$50,000 to engineers on the Macintosh team. So he went to Jobs to ask for one. Jobs\nresponded that Belleville had decided not to give the bonuses to people who were on\nleave. Hertzfeld later heard that the decision had actually been made by Jobs, so he\nconfronted him. At first Jobs equivocated, then he said, “Well, let’s assume what you\nare  saying  is  true.  How  does  that  change  things?”  Hertzfeld  said  that  if  Jobs  was\nwithholding the bonus as a reason for him to come back, then he wouldn’t come back as\na matter of principle. Jobs relented, but it left Hertzfeld with a bad taste.\nWhen his leave was coming to an end, Hertzfeld made an appointment to have dinner\nwith Jobs, and they walked from his office to an Italian restaurant a few blocks away. “I\nreally want to return,” he told Jobs. “But things seem really messed up right now.” Jobs\nwas vaguely annoyed and distracted, but Hertzfeld plunged ahead. “The software team\nis completely demoralized and has hardly done a thing for months, and Burrell is so\nfrustrated that he won’t last to the end of the year.”\nAt that point Jobs cut him off. “You don’t know what you’re talking about!” he said.\n“The Macintosh team is doing great, and I’m having the best time of my life right now.\nYou’re just completely out of touch.” His stare was withering, but he also tried to look\namused at Hertzfeld’s assessment.\n“If you really believe that, I don’t think there’s any way that I can come back,”\nHertzfeld replied glumly. “The Mac team that I want to come back to doesn’t even exist\nanymore.”\n“The Mac team had to grow up, and so do you,” Jobs replied. “I want you to come\nback, but if you don’t want to, that’s up to you. You don’t matter as much as you think\nyou do, anyway.”\nHertzfeld didn’t come back.\nBy early 1985 Burrell Smith was also ready to leave. He had worried that it would\nbe hard to quit if Jobs tried to talk him out of it; the reality distortion field was usually\ntoo strong for him to resist. So he plotted with Hertzfeld how he could break free of it.\n“I’ve got it!” he told Hertzfeld one day. “I know the perfect way to quit that will nullify\nthe reality distortion field. I’ll just walk into Steve’s office, pull down my pants, and\nurinate on his desk. What could he say to that? It’s guaranteed to work.” The betting on\nthe Mac team was that even brave Burrell Smith would not have the gumption to do that.\n\nWhen he finally decided he had to make his break, around the time of Jobs’s birthday\nbash, he made an appointment to see Jobs. He was surprised to find Jobs smiling\nbroadly when he walked in. “Are you gonna do it? Are you really gonna do it?” Jobs\nasked. He had heard about the plan.\nSmith looked at him. “Do I have to? I’ll do it if I have to.” Jobs gave him a look, and\nSmith decided it wasn’t necessary. So he resigned less dramatically and walked out on\ngood terms.\nHe was quickly followed by another of the great Macintosh engineers, Bruce Horn.\nWhen Horn went in to say good-bye, Jobs told him, “Everything that’s wrong with the\nMac is your fault.”\nHorn responded, “Well, actually, Steve, a lot of things that are right with the Mac are\nmy fault, and I had to fight like crazy to get those things in.”\n“You’re right,” admitted Jobs. “I’ll give you 15,000 shares to stay.” When Horn\ndeclined the offer, Jobs showed his warmer side. “Well, give me a hug,” he said. And\nso they hugged.\nBut the biggest news that month was the departure from Apple, yet again, of its\ncofounder, Steve Wozniak. Wozniak was then quietly working as a midlevel engineer in\nthe Apple II division, serving as a humble mascot of the roots of the company and\nstaying as far away from management and corporate politics as he could. He felt, with\njustification, that Jobs was not appreciative of the Apple II, which remained the cash\ncow of the company and accounted for 70% of its sales at Christmas 1984. “People in\nthe Apple II group were being treated as very unimportant by the rest of the company,”\nhe later said. “This was despite the fact that the Apple II was by far the largest-selling\nproduct in our company for ages, and would be for years to come.” He even roused\nhimself to do something out of character; he picked up the phone one day and called\nSculley,  berating  him  for  lavishing  so  much  attention  on  Jobs  and  the  Macintosh\ndivision.\nFrustrated, Wozniak decided to leave quietly to start a new company that would\nmake  a  universal  remote  control  device  he  had  invented.  It  would  control  your\ntelevision, stereo, and other electronic devices with a simple set of buttons that you\ncould easily program. He informed the head of engineering at the Apple II division, but\nhe didn’t feel he was important enough to go out of channels and tell Jobs or Markkula.\nSo Jobs first heard about it when the news leaked in the Wall  Street  Journal. In his\nearnest way, Wozniak had openly answered the reporter’s questions when he called.\nYes, he said, he felt that Apple had been giving short shrift to the Apple II division.\n“Apple’s direction has been horrendously wrong for five years,” he said.\nLess than two weeks later Wozniak and Jobs traveled together to the White House,\nwhere Ronald Reagan presented them with the first National Medal of Technology. The\npresident  quoted  what  President  Rutherford  Hayes  had  said  when  first  shown  a\ntelephone—“An amazing invention, but who would ever want to use one?”—and then\nquipped, “I thought at the time that he might be mistaken.” Because of the awkward\n\nsituation surrounding Wozniak’s departure, Apple did not throw a celebratory dinner. So\nJobs and Wozniak went for a walk afterward and ate at a sandwich shop. They chatted\namiably, Wozniak recalled, and avoided any discussion of their disagreements.\nWozniak wanted to make the parting amicable. It was his style. So he agreed to stay\non as a part-time Apple employee at a $20,000 salary and represent the company at\nevents and trade shows. That could have been a graceful way to drift apart. But Jobs\ncould not leave well enough alone. One Saturday, a few weeks after they had visited\nWashington together, Jobs went to the new Palo Alto studios of Hartmut Esslinger,\nwhose company frogdesign had moved there to handle its design work for Apple. There\nhe happened to see sketches that the firm had made for Wozniak’s new remote control\ndevice, and he flew into a rage. Apple had a clause in its contract that gave it the right\nto bar frogdesign from working on other computer-related projects, and Jobs invoked it.\n“I informed them,” he recalled, “that working with Woz wouldn’t be acceptable to us.”\nWhen the Wall  Street  Journal heard what happened, it got in touch with Wozniak,\nwho, as usual, was open and honest. He said that Jobs was punishing him. “Steve Jobs\nhas a hate for me, probably because of the things I said about Apple,” he told the\nreporter. Jobs’s action was remarkably petty, but it was also partly caused by the fact\nthat he understood, in ways that others did not, that the look and style of a product\nserved to brand it. A device that had Wozniak’s name on it and used the same design\nlanguage as Apple’s products might be mistaken for something that Apple had produced.\n“It’s not personal,” Jobs told the newspaper, explaining that he wanted to make sure that\nWozniak’s remote wouldn’t look like something made by Apple. “We don’t want to see\nour design language used on other products. Woz has to find his own resources. He can’t\nleverage off Apple’s resources; we can’t treat him specially.”\nJobs volunteered to pay for the work that frogdesign had already done for Wozniak,\nbut even so the executives at the firm were taken aback. When Jobs demanded that they\nsend him the drawings done for Wozniak or destroy them, they refused. Jobs had to send\nthem a letter invoking Apple’s contractual right. Herbert Pfeifer, the design director of\nthe firm, risked Jobs’s wrath by publicly dismissing his claim that the dispute with\nWozniak was not personal. “It’s a power play,” Pfeifer told the Journal. “They have\npersonal problems between them.”\nHertzfeld was outraged when he heard what Jobs had done. He lived about twelve\nblocks from Jobs, who sometimes would drop by on his walks. “I got so furious about\nthe Wozniak remote episode that when Steve next came over, I wouldn’t let him in the\nhouse,” Hertzfeld recalled. “He knew he was wrong, but he tried to rationalize, and\nmaybe in his distorted reality he was able to.” Wozniak, always a teddy bear even when\nannoyed, hired another design firm and even agreed to stay on Apple’s retainer as a\nspokesman.\n\nShowdown, Spring 1985\nThere were many reasons for the rift between Jobs and Sculley in the spring of 1985.\nSome  were  merely  business  disagreements,  such  as  Sculley’s  attempt  to  maximize\nprofits  by  keeping  the  Macintosh  price  high  when  Jobs  wanted  to  make  it  more\naffordable.  Others  were  weirdly  psychological  and  stemmed  from  the  torrid  and\nunlikely infatuation they initially had with each other. Sculley had painfully craved\nJobs’s affection, Jobs had eagerly sought a father figure and mentor, and when the ardor\nbegan to cool there was an emotional backwash. But at its core, the growing breach had\ntwo fundamental causes, one on each side.\nFor Jobs, the problem was that Sculley never became a product person. He didn’t\nmake the effort, or show the capacity, to understand the fine points of what they were\nmaking. On the contrary, he found Jobs’s passion for tiny technical tweaks and design\ndetails to be obsessive and counterproductive. He had spent his career selling sodas\nand  snacks  whose  recipes  were  largely  irrelevant  to  him.  He  wasn’t  naturally\npassionate about products, which was among the most damning sins that Jobs could\nimagine. “I tried to educate him about the details of engineering,” Jobs recalled, “but he\nhad no idea how products are created, and after a while it just turned into arguments.\nBut I learned that my perspective was right. Products are everything.” He came to see\nSculley as clueless, and his contempt was exacerbated by Sculley’s hunger for his\naffection and delusions that they were very similar.\nFor Sculley, the problem was that Jobs, when he was no longer in courtship or\nmanipulative mode, was frequently obnoxious, rude, selfish, and nasty to other people.\nHe found Jobs’s boorish behavior as despicable as Jobs found Sculley’s lack of passion\nfor product details. Sculley was kind, caring, and polite to a fault. At one point they\nwere planning to meet with Xerox’s vice chair Bill Glavin, and Sculley begged Jobs to\nbehave. But as soon as they sat down, Jobs told Glavin, “You guys don’t have any clue\nwhat you’re doing,” and the meeting broke up. “I’m sorry, but I couldn’t help myself,”\nJobs told Sculley. It was one of many such cases. As Atari’s Al Alcorn later observed,\n“Sculley believed in keeping people happy and worrying about relationships. Steve\ndidn’t give a shit about that. But he did care about the product in a way that Sculley\nnever could, and he was able to avoid having too many bozos working at Apple by\ninsulting anyone who wasn’t an A player.”\nThe board became increasingly alarmed at the turmoil, and in early 1985 Arthur\nRock and some other disgruntled directors delivered a stern lecture to both. They told\nSculley that he was supposed to be running the company, and he should start doing so\nwith more authority and less eagerness to be pals with Jobs. They told Jobs that he was\nsupposed to be fixing the mess at the Macintosh division and not telling other divisions\nhow to do their job. Afterward Jobs retreated to his office and typed on his Macintosh,\n\n“I will not criticize the rest of the organization, I will not criticize the rest of the\norganization ...”\nAs the Macintosh continued to disappoint—sales in March 1985 were only 10% of\nthe budget forecast—Jobs holed up in his office fuming or wandered the halls berating\neveryone else for the problems. His mood swings became worse, and so did his abuse\nof those around him. Middle-level managers began to rise up against him. The marketing\nchief Mike Murray sought a private meeting with Sculley at an industry conference. As\nthey were going up to Sculley’s hotel room, Jobs spotted them and asked to come along.\nMurray asked him not to. He told Sculley that Jobs was wreaking havoc and had to be\nremoved from managing the Macintosh division. Sculley replied that he was not yet\nresigned to having a showdown with Jobs. Murray later sent a memo directly to Jobs\ncriticizing the way he treated colleagues and denouncing “management by character\nassassination.”\nFor a few weeks it seemed as if there might be a solution to the turmoil. Jobs\nbecame fascinated by a flat-screen technology developed by a firm near Palo Alto\ncalled Woodside Design, run by an eccentric engineer named Steve Kitchen. He also\nwas  impressed  by  another  startup  that  made  a  touchscreen  display  that  could  be\ncontrolled by your finger, so you didn’t need a mouse. Together these might help fulfill\nJobs’s vision of creating a “Mac in a book.” On a walk with Kitchen, Jobs spotted a\nbuilding in nearby Menlo Park and declared that they should open a skunkworks facility\nto work on these ideas. It could be called AppleLabs and Jobs could run it, going back\nto the joy of having a small team and developing a great new product.\nSculley  was  thrilled  by  the  possibility.  It  would  solve  most  of  his  management\nissues, moving Jobs back to what he did best and getting rid of his disruptive presence\nin Cupertino. Sculley also had a candidate to replace Jobs as manager of the Macintosh\ndivision: Jean-Louis Gassée, Apple’s chief in France, who had suffered through Jobs’s\nvisit  there.  Gassée  flew  to  Cupertino  and  said  he  would  take  the  job  if  he  got  a\nguarantee that he would run the division rather than work under Jobs. One of the board\nmembers, Phil Schlein of Macy’s, tried to convince Jobs that he would be better off\nthinking up new products and inspiring a passionate little team.\nBut after some reflection, Jobs decided that was not the path he wanted. He declined\nto cede control to Gassée, who wisely went back to Paris to avoid the power clash that\nwas becoming inevitable. For the rest of the spring, Jobs vacillated. There were times\nwhen he wanted to assert himself as a corporate manager, even writing a memo urging\ncost savings by eliminating free beverages and first-class air travel, and other times\nwhen  he  agreed  with  those  who  were  encouraging  him  to  go  off  and  run  a  new\nAppleLabs R&D group.\nIn March Murray let loose with another memo that he marked “Do not circulate” but\ngave to multiple colleagues. “In my three years at Apple, I’ve never observed so much\nconfusion, fear, and dysfunction as in the past 90 days,” he began. “We are perceived by\nthe rank and file as a boat without a rudder, drifting away into foggy oblivion.” Murray\n\nhad been on both sides of the fence; at times he conspired with Jobs to undermine\nSculley, but in this memo he laid the blame on Jobs. “Whether the cause of or because\nof the dysfunction, Steve Jobs now controls a seemingly impenetrable power base.”\nAt the end of that month, Sculley finally worked up the nerve to tell Jobs that he\nshould give up running the Macintosh division. He walked over to Jobs’s office one\nevening and brought the human resources manager, Jay Elliot, to make the confrontation\nmore formal. “There is no one who admires your brilliance and vision more than I do,”\nSculley began. He had uttered such flatteries before, but this time it was clear that there\nwould be a brutal “but” punctuating the thought. And there was. “But this is really not\ngoing to work,” he declared. The flatteries punctured by “buts” continued. “We have\ndeveloped a great friendship with each other,” he said, “but I have lost confidence in\nyour ability to run the Macintosh division.” He also berated Jobs for badmouthing him\nas a bozo behind his back.\nJobs looked stunned and countered with an odd challenge, that Sculley should help\nand coach him more: “You’ve got to spend more time with me.” Then he lashed back.\nHe told Sculley he knew nothing about computers, was doing a terrible job running the\ncompany, and had disappointed Jobs ever since coming to Apple. Then he began to cry.\nSculley sat there biting his fingernails.\n“I’m  going  to  bring  this  up  with  the  board,”  Sculley  declared.  “I’m  going  to\nrecommend that you step down from your operating position of running the Macintosh\ndivision. I want you to know that.” He urged Jobs not to resist and to agree instead to\nwork on developing new technologies and products.\nJobs jumped from his seat and turned his intense stare on Sculley. “I don’t believe\nyou’re going to do that,” he said. “If you do that, you’re going to destroy the company.”\nOver the next few weeks Jobs’s behavior fluctuated wildly. At one moment he would\nbe  talking  about  going  off  to  run  AppleLabs,  but  in  the  next  moment  he  would  be\nenlisting support to have Sculley ousted. He would reach out to Sculley, then lash out at\nhim behind his back, sometimes on the same night. One night at 9 he called Apple’s\ngeneral counsel Al Eisenstat to say he was losing confidence in Sculley and needed his\nhelp convincing the board to fire him; at 11 the same night, he phoned Sculley to say,\n“You’re terrific, and I just want you to know I love working with you.”\nAt the board meeting on April 11, Sculley officially reported that he wanted to ask\nJobs to step down as the head of the Macintosh division and focus instead on new\nproduct  development.  Arthur  Rock,  the  most  crusty  and  independent  of  the  board\nmembers, then spoke. He was fed up with both of them: with Sculley for not having the\nguts to take command over the past year, and with Jobs for “acting like a petulant brat.”\nThe board needed to get this dispute behind them, and to do so it should meet privately\nwith each of them.\nSculley left the room so that Jobs could present first. Jobs insisted that Sculley was\nthe problem because he had no understanding of computers. Rock responded by berating\nJobs. In his growling voice, he said that Jobs had been behaving foolishly for a year and\n\nhad no right to be managing a division. Even Jobs’s strongest supporter, Phil Schlein,\ntried to talk him into stepping aside gracefully to run a research lab for the company.\nWhen it was Sculley’s turn to meet privately with the board, he gave an ultimatum:\n“You can back me, and then I take responsibility for running the company, or we can do\nnothing, and you’re going to have to find yourselves a new CEO.” If given the authority,\nhe said, he would not move abruptly, but would ease Jobs into the new role over the\nnext few months. The board unanimously sided with Sculley. He was given the authority\nto remove Jobs whenever he felt the timing was right. As Jobs waited outside the\nboardroom,  knowing  full  well  that  he  was  losing,  he  saw  Del  Yocam,  a  longtime\ncolleague, and hugged him.\nAfter the board made its decision, Sculley tried to be conciliatory. Jobs asked that\nthe transition occur slowly, over the next few months, and Sculley agreed. Later that\nevening Sculley’s executive assistant, Nanette Buckhout, called Jobs to see how he was\ndoing. He was still in his office, shell-shocked. Sculley had already left, and Jobs came\nover  to  talk  to  her.  Once  again  he  began  oscillating  wildly  in  his  attitude  toward\nSculley. “Why did John do this to me?” he said. “He betrayed me.” Then he swung the\nother way. Perhaps he should take some time away to work on restoring his relationship\nwith Sculley, he said. “John’s friendship is more important than anything else, and I\nthink maybe that’s what I should do, concentrate on our friendship.”\nPlotting a Coup\nJobs was not good at taking no for an answer. He went to Sculley’s office in early May\n1985 and asked for more time to show that he could manage the Macintosh division. He\nwould prove himself as an operations guy, he promised. Sculley didn’t back down. Jobs\nnext tried a direct challenge: He asked Sculley to resign. “I think you really lost your\nstride,”  Jobs  told  him.  “You  were  really  great  the  first  year,  and  everything  went\nwonderful.  But  something  happened.”  Sculley,  who  generally  was  even-tempered,\nlashed  back,  pointing  out  that  Jobs  had  been  unable  to  get  Macintosh  software\ndeveloped, come up with new models, or win customers. The meeting degenerated into\na shouting match about who was the worse manager. After Jobs stalked out, Sculley\nturned away from the glass wall of his office, where others had been looking in on the\nmeeting, and wept.\nMatters began to come to a head on Tuesday, May 14, when the Macintosh team\nmade its quarterly review presentation to Sculley and other Apple corporate leaders.\nJobs still had not relinquished control of the division, and he was defiant when he\narrived in the corporate boardroom with his team. He and Sculley began by clashing\nover  what  the  division’s  mission  was.  Jobs  said  it  was  to  sell  more  Macintosh\nmachines. Sculley said it was to serve the interests of the Apple company as a whole.\n\nAs usual there was little cooperation among the divisions; for one thing, the Macintosh\nteam was planning new disk drives that were different from those being developed by\nthe Apple II division. The debate, according to the minutes, took a full hour.\nJobs then described the projects under way: a more powerful Mac, which would\ntake the place of the discontinued Lisa; and software called FileServer, which would\nallow Macintosh users to share files on a network. Sculley learned for the first time that\nthese projects were going to be late. He gave a cold critique of Murray’s marketing\nrecord,  Belleville’s  missed  engineering  deadlines,  and  Jobs’s  overall  management.\nDespite all this, Jobs ended the meeting with a plea to Sculley, in front of all the others\nthere, to be given one more chance to prove he could run a division. Sculley refused.\nThat night Jobs took his Macintosh team out to dinner at Nina’s Café in Woodside.\nJean-Louis Gassée was in town because Sculley wanted him to prepare to take over the\nMacintosh division, and Jobs invited him to join them. Belleville proposed a toast “to\nthose of us who really understand what the world according to Steve Jobs is all about.”\nThat phrase—“the world according to Steve”—had been used dismissively by others at\nApple who belittled the reality warp he created. After the others left, Belleville sat with\nJobs in his Mercedes and urged him to organize a battle to the death with Sculley.\nMonths earlier, Apple had gotten the right to export computers to China, and Jobs\nhad been invited to sign a deal in the Great Hall of the People over the 1985 Memorial\nDay weekend. He had told Sculley, who decided he wanted to go himself, which was\njust  fine  with  Jobs.  Jobs  decided  to  use  Sculley’s  absence  to  execute  his  coup.\nThroughout the week leading up to Memorial Day, he took a lot of people on walks to\nshare his plans. “I’m going to launch a coup while John is in China,” he told Mike\nMurray.\nSeven Days in May\nThursday, May 23: At his regular Thursday meeting with his top lieutenants in the\nMacintosh division, Jobs told his inner circle about his plan to oust Sculley. He also\nconfided in the corporate human resources director, Jay Elliot, who told him bluntly that\nthe proposed rebellion wouldn’t work. Elliot had talked to some board members and\nurged them to stand up for Jobs, but he discovered that most of the board was with\nSculley, as were most members of Apple’s senior staff. Yet Jobs barreled ahead. He\neven revealed his plans to Gassée on a walk around the parking lot, despite the fact that\nGassée had come from Paris to take his job. “I made the mistake of telling Gassée,”\nJobs wryly conceded years later.\nThat evening Apple’s general counsel Al Eisenstat had a small barbecue at his home\nfor  Sculley,  Gassée,  and  their  wives.  When  Gassée  told  Eisenstat  what  Jobs  was\nplotting, he recommended that Gassée inform Sculley. “Steve was trying to raise a cabal\n\nand have a coup to get rid of John,” Gassée recalled. “In the den of Al Eisenstat’s\nhouse,  I  put  my  index  finger  lightly  on  John’s  breastbone  and  said,  ‘If  you  leave\ntomorrow for China, you could be ousted. Steve’s plotting to get rid of you.’”\nFriday, May 24: Sculley canceled his trip and decided to confront Jobs at the executive\nstaff meeting on Friday morning. Jobs arrived late, and he saw that his usual seat next to\nSculley, who sat at the head of the table, was taken. He sat instead at the far end. He\nwas dressed in a well-tailored suit and looked energized. Sculley looked pale. He\nannounced that he was dispensing with the agenda to confront the issue on everyone’s\nmind. “It’s come to my attention that you’d like to throw me out of the company,” he\nsaid, looking directly at Jobs. “I’d like to ask you if that’s true.”\nJobs was not expecting this. But he was never shy about indulging in brutal honesty.\nHis eyes narrowed, and he fixed Sculley with his unblinking stare. “I think you’re bad\nfor Apple, and I think you’re the wrong person to run the company,” he replied, coldly\nand slowly. “You really should leave this company. You don’t know how to operate and\nnever have.” He accused Sculley of not understanding the product development process,\nand then he added a self-centered swipe: “I wanted you here to help me grow, and\nyou’ve been ineffective in helping me.”\nAs the rest of the room sat frozen, Sculley finally lost his temper. A childhood stutter\nthat had not afflicted him for twenty years started to return. “I don’t trust you, and I\nwon’t tolerate a lack of trust,” he stammered. When Jobs claimed that he would be\nbetter than Sculley at running the company, Sculley took a gamble. He decided to poll\nthe room on that question. “He pulled off this clever maneuver,” Jobs recalled, still\nsmarting thirty-five years later. “It was at the executive committee meeting, and he said,\n‘It’s me or Steve, who do you vote for?’ He set the whole thing up so that you’d kind of\nhave to be an idiot to vote for me.”\nSuddenly the frozen onlookers began to squirm. Del Yocam had to go first. He said\nhe loved Jobs, wanted him to continue to play some role in the company, but he worked\nup the nerve to conclude, with Jobs staring at him, that he “respected” Sculley and\nwould support him to run the company. Eisenstat faced Jobs directly and said much the\nsame thing: He liked Jobs but was supporting Sculley. Regis McKenna, who sat in on\nsenior staff meetings as an outside consultant, was more direct. He looked at Jobs and\ntold him he was not yet ready to run the company, something he had told him before.\nOthers sided with Sculley as well. For Bill Campbell, it was particularly tough. He was\nfond of Jobs and didn’t particularly like Sculley. His voice quavered a bit as he told\nJobs he had decided to support Sculley, and he urged the two of them to work it out and\nfind  some  role  for  Jobs  to  play  in  the  company.  “You  can’t  let  Steve  leave  this\ncompany,” he told Sculley.\nJobs looked shattered. “I guess I know where things stand,” he said, and bolted out\nof the room. No one followed.\n\nHe went back to his office, gathered his longtime loyalists on the Macintosh staff,\nand started to cry. He would have to leave Apple, he said. As he started to walk out the\ndoor, Debi Coleman restrained him. She and the others urged him to settle down and not\ndo anything hasty. He should take the weekend to regroup. Perhaps there was a way to\nprevent the company from being torn apart.\nSculley was devastated by his victory. Like a wounded warrior, he retreated to\nEisenstat’s office and asked the corporate counsel to go for a ride. When they got into\nEisenstat’s Porsche, Sculley lamented, “I don’t know whether I can go through with\nthis.” When Eisenstat asked what he meant, Sculley responded, “I think I’m going to\nresign.”\n“You can’t,” Eisenstat protested. “Apple will fall apart.”\n“I’m going to resign,” Sculley declared. “I don’t think I’m right for the company.”\n“I think you’re copping out,” Eisenstat replied. “You’ve got to stand up to him.”\nThen he drove Sculley home.\nSculley’s wife was surprised to see him back in the middle of the day. “I’ve failed,”\nhe  said  to  her  forlornly.  She  was  a  volatile  woman  who  had  never  liked  Jobs  or\nappreciated her husband’s infatuation with him. So when she heard what had happened,\nshe jumped into her car and sped over to Jobs’s office. Informed that he had gone to the\nGood Earth restaurant, she marched over there and confronted him in the parking lot as\nhe was coming out with loyalists on his Macintosh team.\n“Steve, can I talk to you?” she said. His jaw dropped. “Do you have any idea what a\nprivilege it has been even to know someone as fine as John Sculley?” she demanded.\nHe averted his gaze. “Can’t you look me in the eyes when I’m talking to you?” she\nasked. But when Jobs did so—giving her his practiced, unblinking stare—she recoiled.\n“Never mind, don’t look at me,” she said. “When I look into most people’s eyes, I see a\nsoul. When I look into your eyes, I see a bottomless pit, an empty hole, a dead zone.”\nThen she walked away.\nSaturday, May 25: Mike Murray drove to Jobs’s house in Woodside to offer some\nadvice: He should consider accepting the role of being a new product visionary, starting\nAppleLabs, and getting away from headquarters. Jobs seemed willing to consider it. But\nfirst he would have to restore peace with Sculley. So he picked up the telephone and\nsurprised Sculley with an olive branch. Could they meet the following afternoon, Jobs\nasked, and take a walk together in the hills above Stanford University. They had walked\nthere in the past, in happier times, and maybe on such a walk they could work things out.\nJobs did not know that Sculley had told Eisenstat he wanted to quit, but by then it\ndidn’t matter. Overnight, he had changed his mind and decided to stay. Despite the\nblowup the day before, he was still eager for Jobs to like him. So he agreed to meet the\nnext afternoon.\n\nIf Jobs was prepping for conciliation, it didn’t show in the choice of movie he\nwanted to see with Murray that night. He picked Patton, the epic of the never-surrender\ngeneral. But he had lent his copy of the tape to his father, who had once ferried troops\nfor the general, so he drove to his childhood home with Murray to retrieve it. His\nparents weren’t there, and he didn’t have a key. They walked around the back, checked\nfor unlocked doors or windows, and finally gave up. The video store didn’t have a copy\nof Patton in stock, so in the end he had to settle for watching the 1983 film adaptation of\nHarold Pinter’s Betrayal.\nSunday, May 26: As planned, Jobs and Sculley met in back of the Stanford campus on\nSunday  afternoon  and  walked  for  several  hours  amid  the  rolling  hills  and  horse\npastures. Jobs reiterated his plea that he should have an operational role at Apple. This\ntime Sculley stood firm. It won’t work, he kept saying. Sculley urged him to take the\nrole of being a product visionary with a lab of his own, but Jobs rejected this as making\nhim into a mere “figurehead.” Defying all connection to reality, he countered with the\nproposal that Sculley give up control of the entire company to him. “Why don’t you\nbecome chairman and I’ll become president and chief executive officer?” he suggested.\nSculley was struck by how earnest he seemed.\n“Steve, that doesn’t make any sense,” Sculley replied. Jobs then proposed that they\nsplit the duties of running the company, with him handling the product side and Sculley\nhandling marketing and business. But the board had not only emboldened Sculley, it had\nordered him to bring Jobs to heel. “One person has got to run the company,” he replied.\n“I’ve got the support and you don’t.”\nOn his way home, Jobs stopped at Mike Markkula’s house. He wasn’t there, so Jobs\nleft a message asking him to come to dinner the following evening. He would also invite\nthe  core  of  loyalists  from  his  Macintosh  team.  He  hoped  that  they  could  persuade\nMarkkula of the folly of siding with Sculley.\nMonday, May 27: Memorial Day was sunny and warm. The Macintosh team loyalists—\nDebi  Coleman,  Mike  Murray,  Susan  Barnes,  and  Bob  Belleville—got  to  Jobs’s\nWoodside home an hour before the scheduled dinner so they could plot strategy. Sitting\non the patio as the sun set, Coleman told Jobs that he should accept Sculley’s offer to be\na product visionary and help start up AppleLabs. Of all the inner circle, Coleman was\nthe most willing to be realistic. In the new organization plan, Sculley had tapped her to\nrun the manufacturing division because he knew that her loyalty was to Apple and not\njust to Jobs. Some of the others were more hawkish. They wanted to urge Markkula to\nsupport a reorganization plan that put Jobs in charge.\nWhen Markkula showed up, he agreed to listen with one proviso: Jobs had to keep\nquiet. “I seriously wanted to hear the thoughts of the Macintosh team, not watch Jobs\n\nenlist  them  in  a  rebellion,”  he  recalled.  As  it  turned  cooler,  they  went  inside  the\nsparsely furnished mansion and sat by a fireplace. Instead of letting it turn into a gripe\nsession, Markkula made them focus on very specific management issues, such as what\nhad caused the problem in producing the FileServer software and why the Macintosh\ndistribution system had not responded well to the change in demand. When they were\nfinished, Markkula bluntly declined to back Jobs. “I said I wouldn’t support his plan,\nand that was the end of that,” Markkula recalled. “Sculley was the boss. They were mad\nand emotional and putting together a revolt, but that’s not how you do things.”\nTuesday, May 28: His ire stoked by hearing from Markkula that Jobs had spent the\nprevious evening trying to subvert him, Sculley walked over to Jobs’s office on Tuesday\nmorning. He had talked to the board, he said, and he had its support. He wanted Jobs\nout.  Then  he  drove  to  Markkula’s  house,  where  he  gave  a  presentation  of  his\nreorganization plans. Markkula asked detailed questions, and at the end he gave Sculley\nhis blessing. When he got back to his office, Sculley called the other members of the\nboard, just to make sure he still had their backing. He did.\nAt that point he called Jobs to make sure he understood. The board had given final\napproval of his reorganization plan, which would proceed that week. Gassée would\ntake over control of Jobs’s beloved Macintosh as well as other products, and there was\nno other division for Jobs to run. Sculley was still somewhat conciliatory. He told Jobs\nthat he could stay on with the title of board chairman and be a product visionary with no\noperational duties. But by this point, even the idea of starting a skunk-works such as\nAppleLabs was no longer on the table.\nIt finally sank in. Jobs realized there was no appeal, no way to warp the reality. He\nbroke down in tears and started making phone calls—to Bill Campbell, Jay Elliot, Mike\nMurray, and others. Murray’s wife, Joyce, was on an overseas call when Jobs phoned,\nand the operator broke in saying it was an emergency. It better be important, she told the\noperator. “It is,” she heard Jobs say. When her husband got on the phone, Jobs was\ncrying. “It’s over,” he said. Then he hung up.\nMurray was worried that Jobs was so despondent he might do something rash, so he\ncalled back. There was no answer, so he drove to Woodside. No one came to the door\nwhen he knocked, so he went around back and climbed up some exterior steps and\nlooked in the bedroom. Jobs was lying there on a mattress in his unfurnished room. He\nlet Murray in and they talked until almost dawn.\nWednesday, May 29: Jobs finally got hold of a tape of Patton,  which  he  watched\nWednesday evening, but Murray prevented him from getting stoked up for another battle.\nInstead  he  urged  Jobs  to  come  in  on  Friday  for  Sculley’s  announcement  of  the\n\nreorganization plan. There was no option left other than to play the good soldier rather\nthan the renegade commander.\nLike a Rolling Stone\nJobs slipped quietly into the back row of the auditorium to listen to Sculley explain to\nthe troops the new order of battle. There were a lot of sideways glances, but few people\nacknowledged him and none came over to provide public displays of affection. He\nstared without blinking at Sculley, who would remember “Steve’s look of contempt”\nyears later. “It’s unyielding,” Sculley recalled, “like an X-ray boring inside your bones,\ndown to where you’re soft and destructibly mortal.” For a moment, standing onstage\nwhile pretending not to notice Jobs, Sculley thought back to a friendly trip they had\ntaken a year earlier to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to visit Jobs’s hero, Edwin Land. He\nhad  been  dethroned  from  the  company  he  created,  Polaroid,  and  Jobs  had  said  to\nSculley in disgust, “All he did was blow a lousy few million and they took his company\naway from him.” Now, Sculley reflected, he was taking Jobs’s company away from him.\nAs Sculley went over the organizational chart, he introduced Gassée as the new head\nof a combined Macintosh and Apple II product group. On the chart was a small box\nlabeled “chairman” with no lines connecting to it, not to Sculley or to anyone else.\nSculley briefly noted that in that role, Jobs would play the part of “global visionary.”\nBut  he  didn’t  acknowledge  Jobs’s  presence.  There  was  a  smattering  of  awkward\napplause.\nJobs stayed home for the next few days, blinds drawn, his answering machine on,\nseeing only his girlfriend, Tina Redse. For hours on end he sat there playing his Bob\nDylan tapes, especially “The Times They Are a-Changin.’” He had recited the second\nverse  the  day  he  unveiled  the  Macintosh  to  the  Apple  shareholders  sixteen  months\nearlier. That verse ended nicely: “For the loser now / Will be later to win. ...”\nA rescue squad from his former Macintosh posse arrived to dispel the gloom on\nSunday night, led by Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson. Jobs took a while to answer\ntheir knock, and then he led them to a room next to the kitchen that was one of the few\nplaces with any furniture. With Redse’s help, he served some vegetarian food he had\nordered. “So what really happened?” Hertzfeld asked. “Is it really as bad as it looks?”\n“No,  it’s  worse.”  Jobs  grimaced.  “It’s  much  worse  than  you  can  imagine.”  He\nblamed Sculley for betraying him, and said that Apple would not be able to manage\nwithout him. His role as chairman, he complained, was completely ceremonial. He was\nbeing  ejected  from  his  Bandley  3  office  to  a  small  and  almost  empty  building  he\nnicknamed “Siberia.” Hertzfeld turned the topic to happier days, and they began to\nreminisce about the past.\n\nEarlier  that  week,  Dylan  had  released  a  new  album, Empire  Burlesque,  and\nHertzfeld  brought  a  copy  that  they  played  on  Jobs’s  high-tech  turntable.  The  most\nnotable  track,  “When  the  Night  Comes  Falling  from  the  Sky,”  with  its  apocalyptic\nmessage, seemed appropriate for the evening, but Jobs didn’t like it. It sounded almost\ndisco, and he gloomily argued that Dylan had been going downhill since Blood on the\nTracks. So Hertzfeld moved the needle to the last song on the album, “Dark Eyes,”\nwhich was a simple acoustic number featuring Dylan alone on guitar and harmonica. It\nwas slow and mournful and, Hertzfeld hoped, would remind Jobs of the earlier Dylan\ntracks he so loved. But Jobs didn’t like that song either and had no desire to hear the\nrest of the album.\nJobs’s overwrought reaction was understandable. Sculley had once been a father\nfigure to him. So had Mike Markkula. So had Arthur Rock. That week all three had\nabandoned him. “It gets back to the deep feeling of being rejected at an early age,” his\nfriend and lawyer George Riley later said. “It’s a deep part of his own mythology, and it\ndefines to himself who he is.” Jobs recalled years later, “I felt like I’d been punched,\nthe air knocked out of me and I couldn’t breathe.”\nLosing the support of Arthur Rock was especially painful. “Arthur had been like a\nfather to me,” Jobs said. “He took me under his wing.” Rock had taught him about\nopera, and he and his wife, Toni, had been his hosts in San Francisco and Aspen. “I\nremember driving into San Francisco one time, and I said to him, ‘God, that Bank of\nAmerica building is ugly,’ and he said, ‘No, it’s the best,’ and he proceeded to lecture\nme,  and  he  was  right  of  course.”  Years  later  Jobs’s  eyes  welled  with  tears  as  he\nrecounted the story: “He chose Sculley over me. That really threw me for a loop. I\nnever thought he would abandon me.”\nMaking matters worse was that his beloved company was now in the hands of a man\nhe considered a bozo. “The board felt that I couldn’t run a company, and that was their\ndecision to make,” he said. “But they made one mistake. They should have separated the\ndecision of what to do with me and what to do with Sculley. They should have fired\nSculley, even if they didn’t think I was ready to run Apple.” Even as his personal gloom\nslowly lifted, his anger at Sculley, his feeling of betrayal, deepened.\nThe situation worsened when Sculley told a group of analysts that he considered\nJobs  irrelevant  to  the  company,  despite  his  title  as  chairman.  “From  an  operations\nstandpoint, there is no role either today or in the future for Steve Jobs,” he said. “I don’t\nknow what he’ll do.” The blunt comment shocked the group, and a gasp went through the\nauditorium.\nPerhaps getting away to Europe would help, Jobs thought. So in June he went to\nParis, where he spoke at an Apple event and went to a dinner honoring Vice President\nGeorge H. W. Bush. From there he went to Italy, where he drove the hills of Tuscany\nwith Redse and bought a bike so he could spend time riding by himself. In Florence he\nsoaked  in  the  architecture  of  the  city  and  the  texture  of  the  building  materials.\nParticularly memorable were the paving stones, which came from Il Casone quarry near\n\nthe Tuscan town of Firenzuola. They were a calming bluish gray. Twenty years later he\nwould  decide  that  the  floors  of  most  major  Apple  stores  would  be  made  of  this\nsandstone.\nThe Apple II was just going on sale in Russia, so Jobs headed off to Moscow, where\nhe  met  up  with  Al  Eisenstat.  Because  there  was  a  problem  getting  Washington’s\napproval for some of the required export licenses, they visited the commercial attaché\nat the American embassy in Moscow, Mike Merin. He warned them that there were\nstrict laws against sharing technology with the Soviets. Jobs was annoyed. At the Paris\ntrade show, Vice President Bush had encouraged him to get computers into Russia in\norder to “foment revolution from below.” Over dinner at a Georgian restaurant that\nspecialized  in  shish  kebab,  Jobs  continued  his  rant.  “How  could  you  suggest  this\nviolates American law when it so obviously benefits our interests?” he asked Merin.\n“By putting Macs in the hands of Russians, they could print all their newspapers.”\nJobs also showed his feisty side in Moscow by insisting on talking about Trotsky, the\ncharismatic revolutionary who fell out of favor and was ordered assassinated by Stalin.\nAt one point the KGB agent assigned to him suggested he tone down his fervor. “You\ndon’t want to talk about Trotsky,” he said. “Our historians have studied the situation,\nand we don’t believe he’s a great man anymore.” That didn’t help. When they got to the\nstate university in Moscow to speak to computer students, Jobs began his speech by\npraising Trotsky. He was a revolutionary Jobs could identify with.\nJobs and Eisenstat attended the July Fourth party at the American embassy, and in his\nthank-you letter to Ambassador Arthur Hartman, Eisenstat noted that Jobs planned to\npursue  Apple’s  ventures  in  Russia  more  vigorously  in  the  coming  year.  “We  are\ntentatively planning on returning to Moscow in September.” For a moment it looked as\nif Sculley’s hope that Jobs would turn into a “global visionary” for the company might\ncome  to  pass.  But  it  was  not  to  be.  Something  much  different  was  in  store  for\nSeptember.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\nNeXT\nPrometheus Unbound\nThe Pirates Abandon Ship\nUpon his return from Europe in August 1985, while he was casting about for what to do\nnext, Jobs called the Stanford biochemist Paul Berg to discuss the advances that were\nbeing made in gene splicing and recombinant DNA. Berg described how difficult it was\nto do experiments in a biology lab, where it could take weeks to nurture an experiment\nand  get  a  result.  “Why  don’t  you  simulate  them  on  a  computer?”  Jobs  asked.  Berg\nreplied  that  computers  with  such  capacities  were  too  expensive  for  university  labs.\n“Suddenly, he was excited about the possibilities,” Berg recalled. “He had it in his\nmind to start a new company. He was young and rich, and had to find something to do\nwith the rest of his life.”\nJobs had already been canvassing academics to ask what their workstation needs\nwere. It was something he had been interested in since 1983, when he had visited the\ncomputer science department at Brown to show off the Macintosh, only to be told that it\n\nwould take a far more powerful machine to do anything useful in a university lab. The\ndream of academic researchers was to have a workstation that was both powerful and\npersonal. As head of the Macintosh division, Jobs had launched a project to build such\na machine, which was dubbed the Big Mac. It would have a UNIX operating system but\nwith the friendly Macintosh interface. But after Jobs was ousted from the Macintosh\ndivision, his replacement, Jean-Louis Gassée, canceled the Big Mac.\nWhen  that  happened,  Jobs  got  a  distressed  call  from  Rich  Page,  who  had  been\nengineering the Big Mac’s chip set. It was the latest in a series of conversations that\nJobs was having with disgruntled Apple employees urging him to start a new company\nand rescue them. Plans to do so began to jell over Labor Day weekend, when Jobs\nspoke to Bud Tribble, the original Macintosh software chief, and floated the idea of\nstarting a company to build a powerful but personal workstation. He also enlisted two\nother Macintosh division employees who had been talking about leaving, the engineer\nGeorge Crow and the controller Susan Barnes.\nThat left one key vacancy on the team: a person who could market the new product to\nuniversities. The obvious candidate was Dan’l Lewin, who at Apple had organized a\nconsortium of universities to buy Macintosh computers in bulk. Besides missing two\nletters  in  his  first  name,  Lewin  had  the  chiseled  good  looks  of  Clark  Kent  and  a\nPrincetonian’s polish. He and Jobs shared a bond: Lewin had written a Princeton thesis\non Bob Dylan and charismatic leadership, and Jobs knew something about both of those\ntopics.\nLewin’s university consortium had been a godsend to the Macintosh group, but he\nhad become frustrated after Jobs left and Bill Campbell had reorganized marketing in a\nway that reduced the role of direct sales to universities. He had been meaning to call\nJobs when, that Labor Day weekend, Jobs called first. He drove to Jobs’s unfurnished\nmansion, and they walked the grounds while discussing the possibility of creating a new\ncompany. Lewin was excited, but not ready to commit. He was going to Austin with\nCampbell the following week, and he wanted to wait until then to decide. Upon his\nreturn, he gave his answer: He was in. The news came just in time for the September 13\nApple board meeting.\nAlthough  Jobs  was  still nominally  the  board’s  chairman,  he  had  not  been  to  any\nmeetings since he lost power. He called Sculley, said he was going to attend, and asked\nthat an item be added to the end of the agenda for a “chairman’s report.” He didn’t say\nwhat  it  was  about,  and  Sculley  assumed  it  would  be  a  criticism  of  the  latest\nreorganization. Instead, when his turn came to speak, Jobs described to the board his\nplans to start a new company. “I’ve been thinking a lot, and it’s time for me to get on\nwith my life,” he began. “It’s obvious that I’ve got to do something. I’m thirty years\nold.” Then he referred to some prepared notes to describe his plan to create a computer\nfor  the  higher  education  market.  The  new  company  would  not  be  competitive  with\nApple, he promised, and he would take with him only a handful of non-key personnel.\nHe offered to resign as chairman of Apple, but he expressed hope that they could work\n\ntogether. Perhaps Apple would want to buy the distribution rights to his product, he\nsuggested, or license Macintosh software to it.\nMike Markkula rankled at the possibility that Jobs would hire anyone from Apple.\n“Why would you take anyone at all?” he asked.\n“Don’t get upset,” Jobs assured him and the rest of the board. “These are very low-\nlevel people that you won’t miss, and they will be leaving anyway.”\nThe  board  initially  seemed  disposed  to  wish  Jobs  well  in  his  venture.  After  a\nprivate discussion, the directors even proposed that Apple take a 10% stake in the new\ncompany and that Jobs remain on the board.\nThat night Jobs and his five renegades met again at his house for dinner. He was in\nfavor of taking the Apple investment, but the others convinced him it was unwise. They\nalso agreed that it would be best if they resigned all at once, right away. Then they\ncould make a clean break.\nSo Jobs wrote a formal letter telling Sculley the names of the five who would be\nleaving,  signed  it  in  his  spidery  lowercase  signature,  and  drove  to  Apple  the  next\nmorning to hand it to him before his 7:30 staff meeting.\n“Steve, these are not low-level people,” Sculley said.\n“Well, these people were going to resign anyway,” Jobs replied. “They are going to\nbe handing in their resignations by nine this morning.”\nFrom Jobs’s perspective, he had been honest. The five were not division managers\nor  members  of  Sculley’s  top  team.  They  had  all  felt  diminished,  in  fact,  by  the\ncompany’s  new  organization.  But  from  Sculley’s  perspective,  these  were  important\nplayers;  Page  was  an  Apple  Fellow,  and  Lewin  was  a  key  to  the  higher  education\nmarket. In addition, they knew about the plans for Big Mac; even though it had been\nshelved,  this  was  still  proprietary  information.  Nevertheless  Sculley  was  sanguine.\nInstead of pushing the point, he asked Jobs to remain on the board. Jobs replied that he\nwould think about it.\nBut when Sculley walked into his 7:30 staff meeting and told his top lieutenants who\nwas leaving, there was an uproar. Most of them felt that Jobs had breached his duties as\nchairman and displayed stunning disloyalty to the company. “We should expose him for\nthe fraud that he is so that people here stop regarding him as a messiah,” Campbell\nshouted, according to Sculley.\nCampbell  admitted  that,  although  he  later  became  a  great  Jobs  defender  and\nsupportive  board  member,  he  was  ballistic  that  morning.  “I  was  fucking  furious,\nespecially  about  him  taking  Dan’l  Lewin,”  he  recalled.  “Dan’l  had  built  the\nrelationships with the universities. He was always muttering about how hard it was to\nwork with Steve, and then he left.” Campbell was so angry that he walked out of the\nmeeting to call Lewin at home. When his wife said he was in the shower, Campbell\nsaid,  “I’ll  wait.”  A  few  minutes  later,  when  she  said  he  was  still  in  the  shower,\nCampbell again said, “I’ll wait.” When Lewin finally came on the phone, Campbell\n\nasked him if it was true. Lewin acknowledged it was. Campbell hung up without saying\nanother word.\nAfter hearing the fury of his senior staff, Sculley surveyed the members of the board.\nThey likewise felt that Jobs had misled them with his pledge that he would not raid\nimportant employees. Arthur Rock was especially angry. Even though he had sided with\nSculley during the Memorial Day showdown, he had been able to repair his paternal\nrelationship with Jobs. Just the week before, he had invited Jobs to bring his girlfriend\nup to San Francisco so that he and his wife could meet her, and the four had a nice\ndinner in Rock’s Pacific Heights home. Jobs had not mentioned the new company he\nwas forming, so Rock felt betrayed when he heard about it from Sculley. “He came to\nthe board and lied to us,” Rock growled later. “He told us he was thinking of forming a\ncompany when in fact he had already formed it. He said he was going to take a few\nmiddle-level people. It turned out to be five senior people.” Markkula, in his subdued\nway, was also offended. “He took some top executives he had secretly lined up before\nhe left. That’s not the way you do things. It was ungentlemanly.”\nOver  the  weekend  both  the  board  and  the  executive  staff  convinced  Sculley  that\nApple would have to declare war on its cofounder. Markkula issued a formal statement\naccusing Jobs of acting “in direct contradiction to his statements that he wouldn’t recruit\nany key Apple personnel for his company.” He added ominously, “We are evaluating\nwhat  possible  actions  should  be  taken.”  Campbell  was  quoted  in  the Wall  Street\nJournal as saying he “was stunned and shocked” by Jobs’s behavior.\nJobs had left his meeting with Sculley thinking that things might proceed smoothly, so\nhe had kept quiet. But after reading the newspapers, he felt that he had to respond. He\nphoned a few favored reporters and invited them to his home for private briefings the\nnext day. Then he called Andy Cunningham, who had handled his publicity at Regis\nMcKenna. “I went over to his unfurnished mansiony place in Woodside,” she recalled,\n“and I found him huddled in the kitchen with his five colleagues and a few reporters\nhanging outside on the lawn.” Jobs told her that he was going to do a full-fledged press\nconference  and  started  spewing  some  of  the  derogatory  things  he  was  going  to  say.\nCunningham was appalled. “This is going to reflect badly on you,” she told him. Finally\nhe backed down. He decided that he would give the reporters a copy of the resignation\nletter and limit any on-the-record comments to a few bland statements.\nJobs  had  considered  just  mailing  in  his  letter  of  resignation,  but  Susan  Barnes\nconvinced him that this would be too contemptuous. Instead he drove it to Markkula’s\nhouse,  where  he  also  found  Al  Eisenstat.  There  was  a  tense  conversation  for  about\nfifteen minutes; then Barnes, who had been waiting outside, came to the door to retrieve\nhim before he said anything he would regret. He left behind the letter, which he had\ncomposed on a Macintosh and printed on the new LaserWriter:\nSeptember 17, 1985\n\nDear Mike:\nThis morning’s papers carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me\nas Chairman. I don’t know the source of these reports but they are both misleading to\nthe public and unfair to me.\nYou will recall that at last Thursday’s Board meeting I stated I had decided to\nstart a new venture and I tendered my resignation as Chairman.\nThe Board declined to accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week. I\nagreed to do so in light of the encouragement the Board offered with regard to the\nproposed new venture and the indications that Apple would invest in it. On Friday,\nafter I told John Sculley who would be joining me, he confirmed Apple’s willingness\nto discuss areas of possible collaboration between Apple and my new venture.\nSubsequently the Company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me\nand the new venture. Accordingly, I must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my\nresignation. ...\nAs you know, the company’s recent reorganization left me with no work to do and\nno  access  even  to  regular  management  reports.  I  am  but  30  and  want  still  to\ncontribute and achieve.\nAfter what we have accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both\namicable and dignified.\nYours sincerely, steven p. jobs\nWhen a guy from the facilities team went to Jobs’s office to pack up his belongings, he\nsaw a picture frame on the floor. It contained a photograph of Jobs and Sculley in warm\nconversation, with an inscription from seven months earlier: “Here’s to Great Ideas,\nGreat Experiences, and a Great Friendship! John.” The glass frame was shattered. Jobs\nhad hurled it across the room before leaving. From that day, he never spoke to Sculley\nagain.\nApple’s  stock  went  up  a  full  point,  or  almost  7%,  when  Jobs’s  resignation  was\nannounced. “East Coast stockholders always worried about California flakes running\nthe company,” explained the editor of a tech stock newsletter. “Now with both Wozniak\nand Jobs out, those shareholders are relieved.” But Nolan Bushnell, the Atari founder\nwho had been an amused mentor ten years earlier, told Time that Jobs would be badly\nmissed. “Where is Apple’s inspiration going to come from? Is Apple going to have all\nthe romance of a new brand of Pepsi?”\nAfter a few days of failed efforts to reach a settlement with Jobs, Sculley and the\nApple  board  decided  to  sue  him  “for  breaches  of  fiduciary  obligations.”  The  suit\nspelled out his alleged transgressions:\n\nNotwithstanding his fiduciary obligations to Apple, Jobs, while serving as the Chairman\nof Apple’s Board of Directors and an officer of Apple and pretending loyalty to the\ninterests of Apple ...\n(a) secretly planned the formation of an enterprise to compete with Apple;\n(b) secretly schemed that his competing enterprise would wrongfully take advantage\nof and utilize Apple’s plan to design, develop and market the Next Generation Product\n...\n(c) secretly lured away key employees of Apple.\nAt the time, Jobs owned 6.5 million shares of Apple stock, 11% of the company,\nworth more than $100 million. He began to sell his shares, and within five months had\ndumped them all, retaining only one share so he could attend shareholder meetings if he\nwanted. He was furious, and that was reflected in his passion to start what was, no\nmatter how he spun it, a rival company. “He was angry at Apple,” said Joanna Hoffman,\nwho briefly went to work for the new company. “Aiming at the educational market,\nwhere  Apple  was  strong,  was  simply  Steve  being  vengeful.  He  was  doing  it  for\nrevenge.”\nJobs, of course, didn’t see it that way. “I haven’t got any sort of odd chip on my\nshoulder,” he told Newsweek. Once again he invited his favorite reporters over to his\nWoodside home, and this time he did not have Andy Cunningham there urging him to be\ncircumspect.  He  dismissed  the  allegation  that  he  had  improperly  lured  the  five\ncolleagues from Apple. “These people all called me,” he told the gaggle of journalists\nwho were milling around in his unfurnished living room. “They were thinking of leaving\nthe company. Apple has a way of neglecting people.”\nHe decided to cooperate with a Newsweek cover in order to get his version of the\nstory out, and the interview he gave was revealing. “What I’m best at doing is finding a\ngroup of talented people and making things with them,” he told the magazine. He said\nthat he would always harbor affection for Apple. “I’ll always remember Apple like any\nman remembers the first woman he’s fallen in love with.” But he was also willing to\nfight with its management if need be. “When someone calls you a thief in public, you\nhave to respond.” Apple’s threat to sue him was outrageous. It was also sad. It showed\nthat Apple was no longer a confident, rebellious company. “It’s hard to think that a $2\nbillion company with 4,300 employees couldn’t compete with six people in blue jeans.”\nTo try to counter Jobs’s spin, Sculley called Wozniak and urged him to speak out.\n“Steve can be an insulting and hurtful guy,” he told Time that week. He revealed that\nJobs had asked him to join his new firm—it would have been a sly way to land another\nblow against Apple’s current management—but he wanted no part of such games and\nhad not returned Jobs’s phone call. To the San Francisco Chronicle, he recounted how\nJobs had blocked frogdesign from working on his remote control under the pretense that\n\nit might compete with Apple products. “I look forward to a great product and I wish him\nsuccess, but his integrity I cannot trust,” Wozniak said.\nTo Be on Your Own\n“The best thing ever to happen to Steve is when we fired him, told him to get lost,”\nArthur Rock later said. The theory, shared by many, is that the tough love made him\nwiser and more mature. But it’s not that simple. At the company he founded after being\nousted from Apple, Jobs was able to indulge all of his instincts, both good and bad. He\nwas unbound. The result was a series of spectacular products that were dazzling market\nflops. This was the true learning experience. What prepared him for the great success he\nwould have in Act III was not his ouster from his Act I at Apple but his brilliant failures\nin Act II.\nThe first instinct that he indulged was his passion for design. The name he chose for\nhis new company was rather straightforward: Next. In order to make it more distinctive,\nhe decided he needed a world-class logo. So he courted the dean of corporate logos,\nPaul  Rand.  At  seventy-one,  the  Brooklyn-born  graphic  designer  had  already  created\nsome  of  the  best-known  logos  in  business,  including  those  of Esquire,  IBM,\nWestinghouse, ABC, and UPS. He was under contract to IBM, and his supervisors there\nsaid that it would obviously be a conflict for him to create a logo for another computer\ncompany. So Jobs picked up the phone and called IBM’s CEO, John Akers. Akers was\nout of town, but Jobs was so persistent that he was finally put through to Vice Chairman\nPaul Rizzo. After two days, Rizzo concluded that it was futile to resist Jobs, and he\ngave permission for Rand to do the work.\nRand flew out to Palo Alto and spent time walking with Jobs and listening to his\nvision. The computer would be a cube, Jobs pronounced. He loved that shape. It was\nperfect and simple. So Rand decided that the logo should be a cube as well, one that\nwas tilted at a 28° angle. When Jobs asked for a number of options to consider, Rand\ndeclared that he did not create different options for clients. “I will solve your problem,\nand you will pay me,” he told Jobs. “You can use what I produce, or not, but I will not\ndo options, and either way you will pay me.”\nJobs  admired  that  kind  of  thinking,  so  he  made  what  was  quite  a  gamble.  The\ncompany would pay an astonishing $100,000 flat fee to get one design. “There was a\nclarity in our relationship,” Jobs said. “He had a purity as an artist, but he was astute at\nsolving business problems. He had a tough exterior, and had perfected the image of a\ncurmudgeon, but he was a teddy bear inside.” It was one of Jobs’s highest praises:\npurity as an artist.\nIt  took  Rand  just  two  weeks.  He  flew  back  to  deliver  the  result  to  Jobs  at  his\nWoodside house. First they had dinner, then Rand handed him an elegant and vibrant\n\nbooklet that described his thought process. On the final spread, Rand presented the logo\nhe had chosen. “In its design, color arrangement, and orientation, the logo is a study in\ncontrasts,”  his  booklet  proclaimed.  “Tipped  at  a  jaunty  angle,  it  brims  with  the\ninformality,  friendliness,  and  spontaneity  of  a  Christmas  seal  and  the  authority  of  a\nrubber stamp.” The word “next” was split into two lines to fill the square face of the\ncube, with only the “e” in lowercase. That letter stood out, Rand’s booklet explained, to\nconnote “education, excellence ... e = mc\n2\n.”\nIt was often hard to predict how Jobs would react to a presentation. He could label\nit  shitty  or  brilliant;  one  never  knew  which  way  he  might  go.  But  with  a  legendary\ndesigner such as Rand, the chances were that Jobs would embrace the proposal. He\nstared at the final spread, looked up at Rand, and then hugged him. They had one minor\ndisagreement: Rand had used a dark yellow for the “e” in the logo, and Jobs wanted him\nto change it to a brighter and more traditional yellow. Rand banged his fist on the table\nand declared, “I’ve been doing this for fifty years, and I know what I’m doing.” Jobs\nrelented.\nThe company had not only a new logo, but a new name. No longer was it Next. It\nwas NeXT. Others might not have understood the need to obsess over a logo, much less\npay $100,000 for one. But for Jobs it meant that NeXT was starting life with a world-\nclass feel and identity, even if it hadn’t yet designed its first product. As Markkula had\ntaught him, a great company must be able to impute its values from the first impression it\nmakes.\nAs a bonus, Rand agreed to design a personal calling card for Jobs. He came up\nwith a colorful type treatment, which Jobs liked, but they ended up having a lengthy and\nheated disagreement about the placement of the period after the “P” in Steven P. Jobs.\nRand had placed the period to the right of the “P.”, as it would appear if set in lead type.\nSteve preferred the period to be nudged to the left, under the curve of the “P.”, as is\npossible  with  digital  typography.  “It  was  a  fairly  large  argument  about  something\nrelatively small,” Susan Kare recalled. On this one Jobs prevailed.\nIn order to translate the NeXT logo into the look of real products, Jobs needed an\nindustrial  designer  he  trusted.  He  talked  to  a  few  possibilities,  but  none  of  them\nimpressed  him  as  much  as  the  wild  Bavarian  he  had  imported  to  Apple:  Hartmut\nEsslinger, whose frogdesign had set up shop in Silicon Valley and who, thanks to Jobs,\nhad a lucrative contract with Apple. Getting IBM to permit Paul Rand to do work for\nNeXT was a small miracle willed into existence by Jobs’s belief that reality can be\ndistorted. But that was a snap compared to the likelihood that he could convince Apple\nto permit Esslinger to work for NeXT.\nThis did not keep Jobs from trying. At the beginning of November 1985, just five\nweeks  after  Apple  filed  suit  against  him,  Jobs  wrote  to  Eisenstat  and  asked  for  a\ndispensation. “I spoke with Hartmut Esslinger this weekend and he suggested I write\nyou a note expressing why I wish to work with him and frogdesign on the new products\nfor  NeXT,”  he  said.  Astonishingly,  Jobs’s  argument  was  that  he  did  not  know  what\n\nApple had in the works, but Esslinger did. “NeXT has no knowledge as to the current or\nfuture directions of Apple’s product designs, nor do other design firms we might deal\nwith, so it is possible to inadvertently design similar looking products. It is in both\nApple’s and NeXT’s best interest to rely on Hartmut’s professionalism to make sure this\ndoes  not  occur.”  Eisenstat  recalled  being  flabbergasted  by  Jobs’s  audacity,  and  he\nreplied curtly. “I have previously expressed my concern on behalf of Apple that you are\nengaged in a business course which involves your utilization of Apple’s confidential\nbusiness information,” he wrote. “Your letter does not alleviate my concern in any way.\nIn fact it heightens my concern because it states that you have ‘no knowledge as to the\ncurrent or future directions of Apple’s product designs,’ a statement which is not true.”\nWhat made the request all the more astonishing to Eisenstat was that it was Jobs who,\njust  a  year  earlier,  had  forced  frogdesign  to  abandon  its  work  on  Wozniak’s  remote\ncontrol device.\nJobs  realized  that  in  order  to  work  with  Esslinger  (and  for  a  variety  of  other\nreasons), it would be necessary to resolve the lawsuit that Apple had filed. Fortunately\nSculley was willing. In January 1986 they reached an out-of-court agreement involving\nno financial damages. In return for Apple’s dropping its suit, NeXT agreed to a variety\nof restrictions: Its product would be marketed as a high-end workstation, it would be\nsold directly to colleges and universities, and it would not ship before March 1987.\nApple also insisted that the NeXT machine “not use an operating system compatible\nwith  the  Macintosh,”  though  it  could  be  argued  that  Apple  would  have  been  better\nserved by insisting on just the opposite.\nAfter the settlement Jobs continued to court Esslinger until the designer decided to\nwind down his contract with Apple. That allowed frogdesign to work with NeXT at the\nend of 1986. Esslinger insisted on having free rein, just as Paul Rand had. “Sometimes\nyou have to use a big stick with Steve,” he said. Like Rand, Esslinger was an artist, so\nJobs was willing to grant him indulgences he denied other mortals.\nJobs decreed that the computer should be an absolutely perfect cube, with each side\nexactly a foot long and every angle precisely 90 degrees. He liked cubes. They had\ngravitas but also the slight whiff of a toy. But the NeXT cube was a Jobsian example of\ndesign  desires  trumping  engineering  considerations.  The  circuit  boards,  which  fitted\nnicely into the traditional pizza-box shape, had to be reconfigured and stacked in order\nto nestle into a cube.\nEven worse, the perfection of the cube made it hard to manufacture. Most parts that\nare cast in molds have angles that are slightly greater than pure 90 degrees, so that it’s\neasier to get them out of the mold (just as it is easier to get a cake out of a pan that has\nangles  slightly  greater  than  90  degrees).  But  Esslinger  dictated,  and  Jobs\nenthusiastically agreed, that there would be no such “draft angles” that would ruin the\npurity and perfection of the cube. So the sides had to be produced separately, using\nmolds that cost $650,000, at a specialty machine shop in Chicago. Jobs’s passion for\nperfection was out of control. When he noticed a tiny line in the chassis caused by the\n\nmolds, something that any other computer maker would accept as unavoidable, he flew\nto Chicago and convinced the die caster to start over and do it perfectly. “Not a lot of\ndie casters expect a celebrity to fly in,” noted one of the engineers. Jobs also had the\ncompany buy a $150,000 sanding machine to remove all lines where the mold faces met\nand insisted that the magnesium case be a matte black, which made it more susceptible\nto showing blemishes.\nJobs had always indulged his obsession that the unseen parts of a product should be\ncrafted as beautifully as its façade, just as his father had taught him when they were\nbuilding  a  fence.  This  too  he  took  to  extremes  when  he  found  himself  unfettered  at\nNeXT. He made sure that the screws inside the machine had expensive plating. He even\ninsisted that the matte black finish be coated onto the inside of the cube’s case, even\nthough only repairmen would see it.\nJoe  Nocera,  then  writing  for Esquire,  captured  Jobs’s  intensity  at  a  NeXT  staff\nmeeting:\nIt’s  not  quite  right  to  say  that  he  is  sitting  through  this  staff  meeting,  because  Jobs\ndoesn’t sit through much of anything; one of the ways he dominates is through sheer\nmovement. One moment he’s kneeling in his chair; the next minute he’s slouching in it;\nthe  next  he  has  leaped  out  of  his  chair  entirely  and  is  scribbling  on  the  blackboard\ndirectly  behind  him.  He  is  full  of  mannerisms.  He  bites  his  nails.  He  stares  with\nunnerving  earnestness  at  whoever  is  speaking.  His  hands,  which  are  slightly  and\ninexplicably yellow, are in constant motion.\nWhat particularly struck Nocera was Jobs’s “almost willful lack of tact.” It was more\nthan just an inability to hide his opinions when others said something he thought dumb; it\nwas a conscious readiness, even a perverse eagerness, to put people down, humiliate\nthem, show he was smarter. When Dan’l Lewin handed out an organization chart, for\nexample, Jobs rolled his eyes. “These charts are bullshit,” he interjected. Yet his moods\nstill  swung  wildly,  as  at  Apple.  A  finance  person  came  into  the  meeting  and  Jobs\nlavished praise on him for a “really, really great job on this”; the previous day Jobs had\ntold him, “This deal is crap.”\nOne of NeXT’s first ten employees was an interior designer for the company’s first\nheadquarters, in Palo Alto. Even though Jobs had leased a building that was new and\nnicely designed, he had it completely gutted and rebuilt. Walls were replaced by glass,\nthe carpets were replaced by light hardwood flooring. The process was repeated when\nNeXT moved to a bigger space in Redwood City in 1989. Even though the building was\nbrand-new, Jobs insisted that the elevators be moved so that the entrance lobby would\nbe more dramatic. As a centerpiece, Jobs commissioned I. M. Pei to design a grand\nstaircase that seemed to float in the air. The contractor said it couldn’t be built. Jobs\n\nsaid  it  could,  and  it  was.  Years  later  Jobs  would  make  such  staircases  a  feature  at\nApple’s signature stores.\nThe Computer\nDuring  the  early  months  of  NeXT,  Jobs  and  Dan’l  Lewin  went  on  the  road,  often\naccompanied by a few colleagues, to visit campuses and solicit opinions. At Harvard\nthey  met  with  Mitch  Kapor,  the  chairman  of  Lotus  software,  over  dinner  at  Harvest\nrestaurant. When Kapor began slathering butter on his bread, Jobs asked him, “Have\nyou ever heard of serum cholesterol?” Kapor responded, “I’ll make you a deal. You\nstay away from commenting on my dietary habits, and I will stay away from the subject\nof your personality.” It was meant humorously, but as Kapor later commented, “Human\nrelationships were not his strong suit.” Lotus agreed to write a spreadsheet program for\nthe NeXT operating system.\nJobs wanted to bundle useful content with the machine, so Michael Hawley, one of\nthe engineers, developed a digital dictionary. He learned that a friend of his at Oxford\nUniversity Press had been involved in the typesetting of a new edition of Shakespeare’s\nworks. That meant that there was probably a computer tape he could get his hands on\nand, if so, incorporate it into the NeXT’s memory. “So I called up Steve, and he said\nthat would be awesome, and we flew over to Oxford together.” On a beautiful spring\nday in 1986, they met in the publishing house’s grand building in the heart of Oxford,\nwhere Jobs made an offer of $2,000 plus 74 cents for every computer sold in order to\nhave the rights to Oxford’s edition of Shakespeare. “It will be all gravy to you,” he\nargued. “You will be ahead of the parade. It’s never been done before.” They agreed in\nprinciple and then went out to play skittles over beer at a nearby pub where Lord Byron\nused to drink. By the time it launched, the NeXT would also include a dictionary, a\nthesaurus, and the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, making it one of the pioneers of the\nconcept of searchable electronic books.\nInstead  of  using  off-the-shelf  chips  for  the  NeXT,  Jobs  had  his  engineers  design\ncustom ones that integrated a variety of functions on one chip. That would have been\nhard enough, but Jobs made it almost impossible by continually revising the functions he\nwanted it to do. After a year it became clear that this would be a major source of delay.\nHe also insisted on building his own fully automated and futuristic factory, just as he\nhad for the Macintosh; he had not been chastened by that experience. This time too he\nmade the same mistakes, only more excessively. Machines and robots were painted and\nrepainted as he compulsively revised his color scheme. The walls were museum white,\nas they had been at the Macintosh factory, and there were $20,000 black leather chairs\nand a custom-made staircase, just as in the corporate headquarters. He insisted that the\nmachinery on the 165-foot assembly line be configured to move the circuit boards from\n\nright  to  left  as  they  got  built,  so  that  the  process  would  look  better  to  visitors  who\nwatched from the viewing gallery. Empty circuit boards were fed in at one end and\ntwenty minutes later, untouched by humans, came out the other end as completed boards.\nThe process followed the Japanese principle known as kanban, in which each machine\nperforms its task only when the next machine is ready to receive another part.\nJobs had not tempered his way of dealing with employees. “He applied charm or\npublic humiliation in a way that in most cases proved to be pretty effective,” Tribble\nrecalled.  But  sometimes  it  wasn’t.  One  engineer,  David  Paulsen,  put  in  ninety-hour\nweeks for the first ten months at NeXT. He quit when “Steve walked in one Friday\nafternoon  and  told  us  how  unimpressed  he  was  with  what  we  were  doing.”  When\nBusiness Week asked him why he treated employees so harshly, Jobs said it made the\ncompany better. “Part of my responsibility is to be a yardstick of quality. Some people\naren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.” But he still had his spirit\nand charisma. There were plenty of field trips, visits by aikido masters, and off-site\nretreats. And he still exuded the pirate flag spunkiness. When Apple fired Chiat/Day, the\nad firm that had done the “1984” ad and taken out the newspaper ad saying “Welcome\nIBM—seriously,” Jobs took out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal proclaiming,\n“Congratulations Chiat/Day—Seriously ... Because I can guarantee you: there is life\nafter Apple.”\nPerhaps the greatest similarity to his days at Apple was that Jobs brought with him\nhis reality distortion field. It was on display at the company’s first retreat at Pebble\nBeach  in  late  1985.  There  Jobs  pronounced  that  the  first  NeXT  computer  would  be\nshipped in just eighteen months. It was already clear that this date was impossible, but\nhe blew off a suggestion from one engineer that they be realistic and plan on shipping in\n1988. “If we do that, the world isn’t standing still, the technology window passes us by,\nand all the work we’ve done we have to throw down the toilet,” he argued.\nJoanna Hoffman, the veteran of the Macintosh team who was among those willing to\nchallenge  Jobs,  did  so.  “Reality  distortion  has  motivational  value,  and  I  think  that’s\nfine,” she said as Jobs stood at a whiteboard. “However, when it comes to setting a date\nin a way that affects the design of the product, then we get into real deep shit.” Jobs\ndidn’t agree: “I think we have to drive a stake in the ground somewhere, and I think if\nwe miss this window, then our credibility starts to erode.” What he did not say, even\nthough it was suspected by all, was that if their targets slipped they might run out of\nmoney. Jobs had pledged $7 million of his own funds, but at their current burn rate that\nwould run out in eighteen months if they didn’t start getting some revenue from shipped\nproducts.\nThree months later, when they returned to Pebble Beach for their next retreat, Jobs\nbegan his list of maxims with “The honeymoon is over.” By the time of the third retreat,\nin  Sonoma  in  September  1986,  the  timetable  was  gone,  and  it  looked  as  though  the\ncompany would hit a financial wall.\n\nPerot to the Rescue\nIn late 1986 Jobs sent out a proposal to venture capital firms offering a 10% stake in\nNeXT  for  $3  million.  That  put  a  valuation  on  the  entire  company  of  $30  million,  a\nnumber  that  Jobs  had  pulled  out  of  thin  air.  Less  than  $7  million  had  gone  into  the\ncompany thus far, and there was little to show for it other than a neat logo and some\nsnazzy offices. It had no revenue or products, nor any on the horizon. Not surprisingly,\nthe venture capitalists all passed on the offer to invest.\nThere was, however, one cowboy who was dazzled. Ross Perot, the bantam Texan\nwho  had  founded  Electronic  Data  Systems,  then  sold  it  to  General  Motors  for  $2.4\nbillion,  happened  to  watch  a  PBS  documentary, The  Entrepreneurs,  which  had  a\nsegment on Jobs and NeXT in November 1986. He instantly identified with Jobs and his\ngang, so much so that, as he watched them on television, he said, “I was finishing their\nsentences for them.” It was a line eerily similar to one Sculley had often used. Perot\ncalled Jobs the next day and offered, “If you ever need an investor, call me.”\nJobs did indeed need one, badly. But he was careful not to show it. He waited a\nweek before calling back. Perot sent some of his analysts to size up NeXT, but Jobs\ntook care to deal directly with Perot. One of his great regrets in life, Perot later said,\nwas that he had not bought Microsoft, or a large stake in it, when a very young Bill\nGates had come to visit him in Dallas in 1979. By the time Perot called Jobs, Microsoft\nhad just gone public with a $1 billion valuation. Perot had missed out on the opportunity\nto make a lot of money and have a fun adventure. He was eager not to make that mistake\nagain.\nJobs made an offer to Perot that was three times more costly than had quietly been\noffered to venture capitalists a few months earlier. For $20 million, Perot would get\n16% of the equity in the company, after Jobs put in another $5 million. That meant the\ncompany  would  be  valued  at  about  $126  million.  But  money  was  not  a  major\nconsideration for Perot. After a meeting with Jobs, he declared that he was in. “I pick\nthe jockeys, and the jockeys pick the horses and ride them,” he told Jobs. “You guys are\nthe ones I’m betting on, so you figure it out.”\nPerot brought to NeXT something that was almost as valuable as his $20 million\nlifeline: He was a quotable, spirited cheerleader for the company, who could lend it an\nair of credibility among grown-ups. “In terms of a startup company, it’s one that carries\nthe least risk of any I’ve seen in 25 years in the computer industry,” he told the New\nYork Times. “We’ve had some sophisticated people see the hardware—it blew them\naway. Steve and his whole NeXT team are the darnedest bunch of perfectionists I’ve\never seen.”\nPerot also traveled in rarefied social and business circles that complemented Jobs’s\nown. He took Jobs to a black-tie dinner dance in San Francisco that Gordon and Ann\nGetty gave for King Juan Carlos I of Spain. When the king asked Perot whom he should\n\nmeet, Perot immediately produced Jobs. They were soon engaged in what Perot later\ndescribed as “electric conversation,” with Jobs animatedly describing the next wave in\ncomputing.  At  the  end  the  king  scribbled  a  note  and  handed  it  to  Jobs.  “What\nhappened?” Perot asked. Jobs answered, “I sold him a computer.”\nThese and other stories were incorporated into the mythologized story of Jobs that\nPerot told wherever he went. At a briefing at the National Press Club in Washington, he\nspun Jobs’s life story into a Texas-size yarn about a young man\nso poor he couldn’t afford to go to college, working in his garage at night, playing with\ncomputer chips, which was his hobby, and his dad—who looks like a character out of a\nNorman Rockwell painting—comes in one day and said, “Steve, either make something\nyou can sell or go get a job.” Sixty days later, in a wooden box that his dad made for\nhim,  the  first  Apple  computer  was  created.  And  this  high  school  graduate  literally\nchanged the world.\nThe one phrase that was true was the one about Paul Jobs’s looking like someone in\na  Rockwell  painting.  And  perhaps  the  last  phrase,  the  one  about  Jobs  changing  the\nworld. Certainly Perot believed that. Like Sculley, he saw himself in Jobs. “Steve’s like\nme,” Perot told the Washington Post’s David Remnick. “We’re weird in the same way.\nWe’re soul mates.”\nGates and NeXT\nBill  Gates  was  not  a  soul  mate.  Jobs  had  convinced  him  to  produce  software\napplications  for  the  Macintosh,  which  had  turned  out  to  be  hugely  profitable  for\nMicrosoft.  But  Gates  was  one  person  who  was  resistant  to  Jobs’s  reality  distortion\nfield, and as a result he decided not to create software tailored for the NeXT platform.\nGates went to California to get periodic demonstrations, but each time he came away\nunimpressed. “The Macintosh was truly unique, but I personally don’t understand what\nis so unique about Steve’s new computer,” he told Fortune.\nPart  of  the  problem  was  that  the  rival  titans  were  congenitally  unable  to  be\ndeferential  to  each  other.  When  Gates  made  his  first  visit  to  NeXT’s  Palo  Alto\nheadquarters, in the summer of 1987, Jobs kept him waiting for a half hour in the lobby,\neven  though  Gates  could  see  through  the  glass  walls  that  Jobs  was  walking  around\nhaving casual conversations. “I’d gone down to NeXT and I had the Odwalla, the most\nexpensive  carrot  juice,  and  I’d  never  seen  tech  offices  so  lavish,”  Gates  recalled,\n\nshaking his head with just a hint of a smile. “And Steve comes a half hour late to the\nmeeting.”\nJobs’s sales pitch, according to Gates, was simple. “We did the Mac together,” Jobs\nsaid. “How did that work for you? Very well. Now, we’re going to do this together and\nthis is going to be great.”\nBut  Gates  was  brutal  to  Jobs,  just  as  Jobs  could  be  to  others.  “This  machine  is\ncrap,” he said. “The optical disk has too high latency, the fucking case is too expensive.\nThis thing is ridiculous.” He decided then, and reaffirmed on each subsequent visit, that\nit  made  no  sense  for  Microsoft  to  divert  resources  from  other  projects  to  develop\napplications for NeXT. Worse yet, he repeatedly said so publicly, which made others\nless likely to spend time developing for NeXT. “Develop for it? I’ll piss on it,” he told\nInfoWorld.\nWhen they happened to meet in the hallway at a conference, Jobs started berating\nGates for his refusal to do software for NeXT. “When you get a market, I will consider\nit,”  Gates  replied.  Jobs  got  angry.  “It  was  a  screaming  battle,  right  in  front  of\neverybody,”  recalled  Adele  Goldberg,  the  Xerox  PARC  engineer.  Jobs  insisted  that\nNeXT was the next wave of computing. Gates, as he often did, got more expressionless\nas Jobs got more heated. He finally just shook his head and walked away.\nBeneath their personal rivalry—and occasional grudging respect—was their basic\nphilosophical difference. Jobs believed in an end-to-end integration of hardware and\nsoftware, which led him to build a machine that was not compatible with others. Gates\nbelieved in, and profited from, a world in which different companies made machines\nthat were compatible with one another; their hardware ran a standard operating system\n(Microsoft’s Windows) and could all use the same software apps (such as Microsoft’s\nWord  and  Excel).  “His  product  comes  with  an  interesting  feature  called\nincompatibility,” Gates told the Washington Post. “It doesn’t run any of the existing\nsoftware. It’s a super-nice computer. I don’t think if I went out to design an incompatible\ncomputer I would have done as well as he did.”\nAt  a  forum  in  Cambridge,  Massachusetts,  in  1989,  Jobs  and  Gates  appeared\nsequentially, laying out their competing worldviews. Jobs spoke about how new waves\ncome  along  in  the  computer  industry  every  few  years.  Macintosh  had  launched  a\nrevolutionary new approach with the graphical interface; now NeXT was doing it with\nobject-oriented programming tied to a powerful new machine based on an optical disk.\nEvery major software vendor realized they had to be part of this new wave, he said,\n“except Microsoft.” When Gates came up, he reiterated his belief that Jobs’s end-to-end\ncontrol of the software and the hardware was destined for failure, just as Apple had\nfailed in competing against the Microsoft Windows standard. “The hardware market and\nthe software market are separate,” he said. When asked about the great design that could\ncome from Jobs’s approach, Gates gestured to the NeXT prototype that was still sitting\nonstage and sneered, “If you want black, I’ll get you a can of paint.”\n\nIBM\nJobs  came  up  with  a  brilliant  jujitsu  maneuver  against  Gates,  one  that  could  have\nchanged the balance of power in the computer industry forever. It required Jobs to do\ntwo things that were against his nature: licensing out his software to another hardware\nmaker and getting into bed with IBM. He had a pragmatic streak, albeit a tiny one, so he\nwas able to overcome his reluctance. But his heart was never fully in it, which is why\nthe alliance would turn out to be short-lived.\nIt  began  at  a  party,  a  truly  memorable  one,  for  the  seventieth  birthday  of  the\nWashington Post publisher Katharine Graham in June 1987 in Washington. Six hundred\nguests attended, including President Ronald Reagan. Jobs flew in from California and\nIBM’s chairman John Akers from New York. It was the first time they had met. Jobs\ntook the opportunity to bad-mouth Microsoft and attempt to wean IBM from using its\nWindows operating system. “I couldn’t resist telling him I thought IBM was taking a\ngiant gamble betting its entire software strategy on Microsoft, because I didn’t think its\nsoftware was very good,” Jobs recalled.\nTo Jobs’s delight, Akers replied, “How would you like to help us?” Within a few\nweeks Jobs showed up at IBM’s Armonk, New York, headquarters with his software\nengineer  Bud  Tribble.  They  put  on  a  demo  of  NeXT,  which  impressed  the  IBM\nengineers.  Of  particular  significance  was  NeXTSTEP,  the  machine’s  object-oriented\noperating system. “NeXTSTEP took care of a lot of trivial programming chores that\nslow  down  the  software  development  process,”  said  Andrew  Heller,  the  general\nmanager of IBM’s workstation unit, who was so impressed by Jobs that he named his\nnewborn son Steve.\nThe negotiations lasted into 1988, with Jobs becoming prickly over tiny details. He\nwould  stalk  out  of  meetings  over  disagreements  about  colors  or  design,  only  to  be\ncalmed down by Tribble or Lewin. He didn’t seem to know which frightened him more,\nIBM or Microsoft. In April Perot decided to play host for a mediating session at his\nDallas headquarters, and a deal was struck: IBM would license the current version of\nthe NeXTSTEP software, and if the managers liked it, they would use it on some of\ntheir workstations. IBM sent to Palo Alto a 125-page contract. Jobs tossed it down\nwithout  reading  it.  “You  don’t  get  it,”  he  said  as  he  walked  out  of  the  room.  He\ndemanded a simpler contract of only a few pages, which he got within a week.\nJobs wanted to keep the arrangement secret from Bill Gates until the big unveiling of\nthe NeXT computer, scheduled for October. But IBM insisted on being forthcoming.\nGates was furious. He realized this could wean IBM off its dependence on Microsoft\noperating  systems.  “NeXTSTEP  isn’t  compatible  with  anything,”  he  raged  to  IBM\nexecutives.\nAt first Jobs seemed to have pulled off Gates’s worst nightmare. Other computer\nmakers that were beholden to Microsoft’s operating systems, most notably Compaq and\n\nDell, came to ask Jobs for the right to clone NeXT and license NeXTSTEP. There were\neven  offers  to  pay  a  lot  more  if  NeXT  would  get  out  of  the  hardware  business\naltogether.\nThat  was  too  much  for  Jobs,  at  least  for  the  time  being.  He  cut  off  the  clone\ndiscussions. And he began to cool toward IBM. The chill became reciprocal. When the\nperson  who  made  the  deal  at  IBM  moved  on,  Jobs  went  to  Armonk  to  meet  his\nreplacement,  Jim  Cannavino.  They  cleared  the  room  and  talked  one-on-one.  Jobs\ndemanded more money to keep the relationship going and to license newer versions of\nNeXTSTEP to IBM. Cannavino made no commitments, and he subsequently stopped\nreturning Jobs’s phone calls. The deal lapsed. NeXT got a bit of money for a licensing\nfee, but it never got the chance to change the world.\nThe Launch, October 1988\nJobs had perfected the art of turning product launches into theatrical productions, and\nfor  the  world  premiere  of  the  NeXT  computer—on  October  12,  1988,  in  San\nFrancisco’s Symphony Hall—he wanted to outdo himself. He needed to blow away the\ndoubters. In the weeks leading up to the event, he drove up to San Francisco almost\nevery day to hole up in the Victorian house of Susan Kare, NeXT’s graphic designer,\nwho had done the original fonts and icons for the Macintosh. She helped prepare each\nof the slides as Jobs fretted over everything from the wording to the right hue of green to\nserve as the background color. “I like that green,” he said proudly as they were doing a\ntrial  run  in  front  of  some  staffers.  “Great  green,  great  green,”  they  all  murmured  in\nassent.\nNo detail was too small. Jobs went over the invitation list and even the lunch menu\n(mineral  water,  croissants,  cream  cheese,  bean  sprouts).  He  picked  out  a  video\nprojection  company  and  paid  it  $60,000  for  help.  And  he  hired  the  postmodernist\ntheater  producer  George  Coates  to  stage  the  show.  Coates  and  Jobs  decided,  not\nsurprisingly, on an austere and radically simple stage look. The unveiling of the black\nperfect cube would occur on a starkly minimalist stage setting with a black background,\na table covered by a black cloth, a black veil draped over the computer, and a simple\nvase of flowers. Because neither the hardware nor the operating system was actually\nready, Jobs was urged to do a simulation. But he refused. Knowing it would be like\nwalking a tightrope without a net, he decided to do the demonstration live.\nMore than three thousand people showed up at the event, lining up two hours before\ncurtain time. They were not disappointed, at least by the show. Jobs was onstage for\nthree hours, and he again proved to be, in the words of Andrew Pollack of the New York\nTimes, “the Andrew Lloyd Webber of product introductions, a master of stage flair and\n\nspecial effects.” Wes Smith of the Chicago Tribune said the launch was “to product\ndemonstrations what Vatican II was to church meetings.”\nJobs had the audience cheering from his opening line: “It’s great to be back.” He\nbegan by recounting the history of personal computer architecture, and he promised that\nthey would now witness an event “that occurs only once or twice in a decade—a time\nwhen a new architecture is rolled out that is going to change the face of computing.” The\nNeXT software and hardware were designed, he said, after three years of consulting\nwith  universities  across  the  country.  “What  we  realized  was  that  higher  ed  wants  a\npersonal mainframe.”\nAs usual there were superlatives. The product was “incredible,” he said, “the best\nthing  we  could  have  imagined.”  He  praised  the  beauty  of  even  the  parts  unseen.\nBalancing on his fingertips the foot-square circuit board that would be nestled in the\nfoot-cube box, he enthused, “I hope you get a chance to look at this a little later. It’s the\nmost beautiful printed circuit board I’ve ever seen in my life.” He then showed how the\ncomputer could play speeches—he featured King’s “I Have a Dream” and Kennedy’s\n“Ask Not”—and send email with audio attachments. He leaned into the microphone on\nthe computer to record one of his own. “Hi, this is Steve, sending a message on a pretty\nhistoric day.” Then he asked those in the audience to add “a round of applause” to the\nmessage, and they did.\nOne of Jobs’s management philosophies was that it is crucial, every now and then, to\nroll the dice and “bet the company” on some new idea or technology. At the NeXT\nlaunch, he boasted of an example that, as it turned out, would not be a wise gamble:\nhaving  a  high-capacity  (but  slow)  optical  read/write  disk  and  no  floppy  disk  as  a\nbackup. “Two years ago we made a decision,” he said. “We saw some new technology\nand we made a decision to risk our company.”\nThen he turned to a feature that would prove more prescient. “What we’ve done is\nmade the first real digital books,” he said, noting the inclusion of the Oxford edition of\nShakespeare and other tomes. “There has not been an advancement in the state of the art\nof printed book technology since Gutenberg.”\nAt times he could be amusingly aware of his own foibles, and he used the electronic\nbook demonstration to poke fun at himself. “A word that’s sometimes used to describe\nme is ‘mercurial,’” he said, then paused. The audience laughed knowingly, especially\nthose in the front rows, which were filled with NeXT employees and former members\nof the Macintosh team. Then he pulled up the word in the computer’s dictionary and\nread the first definition: “Of or relating to, or born under the planet Mercury.” Scrolling\ndown,  he  said,  “I  think  the  third  one  is  the  one  they mean:  ‘Characterized  by\nunpredictable changeableness of mood.’” There was a bit more laughter. “If we scroll\ndown the thesaurus, though, we see that the antonym is ‘saturnine.’ Well what’s that? By\nsimply double-clicking on it, we immediately look that up in the dictionary, and here it\nis:  ‘Cold  and  steady  in  moods.  Slow  to  act  or  change.  Of  a  gloomy  or  surly\ndisposition.’” A little smile came across his face as he waited for the ripple of laughter.\n\n“Well,” he concluded, “I don’t think ‘mercurial’ is so bad after all.” After the applause,\nhe used the quotations book to make a more subtle point, about his reality distortion\nfield. The quote he chose was from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass. After\nAlice laments that no matter how hard she tries she can’t believe impossible things, the\nWhite Queen retorts, “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things\nbefore breakfast.” Especially from the front rows, there was a roar of knowing laughter.\nAll of the good cheer served to sugarcoat, or distract attention from, the bad news.\nWhen it came time to announce the price of the new machine, Jobs did what he would\noften do in product demonstrations: reel off the features, describe them as being “worth\nthousands and thousands of dollars,” and get the audience to imagine how expensive it\nreally  should  be.  Then  he  announced  what  he  hoped  would  seem  like  a  low  price:\n“We’re  going  to  be  charging  higher  education  a  single  price  of  $6,500.”  From  the\nfaithful,  there  was  scattered  applause.  But  his  panel  of  academic  advisors  had  long\npushed to keep the price to between $2,000 and $3,000, and they thought that Jobs had\npromised to do so. Some of them were appalled. This was especially true once they\ndiscovered that the optional printer would cost another $2,000, and the slowness of the\noptical disk would make the purchase of a $2,500 external hard disk advisable.\nThere was another disappointment that he tried to downplay: “Early next year, we\nwill have our 0.9 release, which is for software developers and aggressive end users.”\nThere was a bit of nervous laughter. What he was saying was that the real release of the\nmachine and its software, known as the 1.0 release, would not actually be happening in\nearly 1989. In fact he didn’t set a hard date. He merely suggested it would be sometime\nin the second quarter of that year. At the first NeXT retreat back in late 1985, he had\nrefused to budge, despite Joanna Hoffman’s pushback, from his commitment to have the\nmachine finished in early 1987. Now it was clear it would be more than two years later.\nThe event ended on a more upbeat note, literally. Jobs brought onstage a violinist\nfrom the San Francisco Symphony who played Bach’s A Minor Violin Concerto in a\nduet with the NeXT computer onstage. People erupted in jubilant applause. The price\nand  the  delayed  release  were  forgotten  in  the  frenzy.  When  one  reporter  asked  him\nimmediately afterward why the machine was going to be so late, Jobs replied, “It’s not\nlate. It’s five years ahead of its time.”\nAs  would  become  his  standard  practice,  Jobs  offered  to  provide  “exclusive”\ninterviews to anointed publications in return for their promising to put the story on the\ncover. This time he went one “exclusive” too far, though it didn’t really hurt. He agreed\nto a request from Business Week’s Katie Hafner for exclusive access to him before the\nlaunch, but he also made a similar deal with Newsweek and then with Fortune. What he\ndidn’t consider was that one of Fortune’s top editors, Susan Fraker, was married to\nNewsweek’s editor Maynard Parker. At the Fortune story conference, when they were\ntalking excitedly about their exclusive, Fraker mentioned that she happened to know that\nNewsweek had also been promised an exclusive, and it would be coming out a few days\nbefore Fortune. So Jobs ended up that week on only two magazine covers. Newsweek\n\nused the cover line “Mr. Chips” and showed him leaning on a beautiful NeXT, which it\nproclaimed  to  be  “the  most  exciting  machine  in  years.” Business Week  showed  him\nlooking angelic in a dark suit, fingertips pressed together like a preacher or professor.\nBut  Hafner  pointedly  reported  on  the  manipulation  that  surrounded  her  exclusive.\n“NeXT carefully parceled out interviews with its staff and suppliers, monitoring them\nwith  a  censor’s  eye,”  she  wrote.  “That  strategy  worked,  but  at  a  price:  Such\nmaneuvering—self-serving and relentless—displayed the side of Steve Jobs that so hurt\nhim at Apple. The trait that most stands out is Jobs’s need to control events.”\nWhen the hype died down, the reaction to the NeXT computer was muted, especially\nsince  it  was  not  yet  commercially  available.  Bill  Joy,  the  brilliant  and  wry  chief\nscientist at rival Sun Microsystems, called it “the first Yuppie workstation,” which was\nnot an unalloyed compliment. Bill Gates, as might be expected, continued to be publicly\ndismissive.  “Frankly,  I’m  disappointed,”  he  told  the Wall  Street  Journal.  “Back  in\n1981, we were truly excited by the Macintosh when Steve showed it to us, because\nwhen you put it side-by-side with another computer, it was unlike anything anybody had\never seen before.” The NeXT machine was not like that. “In the grand scope of things,\nmost of these features are truly trivial.” He said that Microsoft would continue its plans\nnot to write software for the NeXT. Right after the announcement event, Gates wrote a\nparody  email  to  his  staff.  “All  reality  has  been  completely  suspended,”  it  began.\nLooking back at it, Gates laughs that it may have been “the best email I ever wrote.”\nWhen the NeXT computer finally went on sale in mid-1989, the factory was primed\nto churn out ten thousand units a month. As it turned out, sales were about four hundred a\nmonth. The beautiful factory robots, so nicely painted, remained mostly idle, and NeXT\ncontinued to hemorrhage cash.\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\nPIXAR\nTechnology Meets Art\nEd Catmull, Steve Jobs, and John Lasseter, 1999\nLucasfilm’s Computer Division\nWhen Jobs was losing his footing at Apple in the summer of 1985, he went for a walk\nwith Alan Kay, who had been at Xerox PARC and was then an Apple Fellow. Kay knew\nthat Jobs was interested in the intersection of creativity and technology, so he suggested\nthey go see a friend of his, Ed Catmull, who was running the computer division of\nGeorge Lucas’s film studio. They rented a limo and rode up to Marin County to the edge\nof  Lucas’s  Skywalker  Ranch,  where  Catmull  and  his  little  computer  division  were\nbased. “I was blown away, and I came back and tried to convince Sculley to buy it for\nApple,” Jobs recalled. “But the folks running Apple weren’t interested, and they were\nbusy kicking me out anyway.”\n\nThe Lucasfilm computer division made hardware and software for rendering digital\nimages, and it also had a group of computer animators making shorts, which was led by\na talented cartoon-loving executive named John Lasseter. Lucas, who had completed his\nfirst Star Wars trilogy, was embroiled in a contentious divorce, and he needed to sell\noff the division. He told Catmull to find a buyer as soon as possible.\nAfter  a  few  potential  purchasers  balked  in  the  fall  of  1985,  Catmull  and  his\ncolleague Alvy Ray Smith decided to seek investors so that they could buy the division\nthemselves. So they called Jobs, arranged another meeting, and drove down to his\nWoodside house. After railing for a while about the perfidies and idiocies of Sculley,\nJobs  proposed  that  he  buy  their  Lucasfilm  division  outright.  Catmull  and  Smith\ndemurred: They wanted an investor, not a new owner. But it soon became clear that\nthere was a middle ground: Jobs could buy a majority of the division and serve as\nchairman but allow Catmull and Smith to run it.\n“I wanted to buy it because I was really into computer graphics,” Jobs recalled. “I\nrealized they were way ahead of others in combining art and technology, which is what\nI’ve always been interested in.” He offered to pay Lucas $5 million plus invest another\n$5 million to capitalize the division as a stand-alone company. That was far less than\nLucas had been asking, but the timing was right. They decided to negotiate a deal.\nThe chief financial officer at Lucasfilm found Jobs arrogant and prickly, so when it\ncame time to hold a meeting of all the players, he told Catmull, “We have to establish\nthe right pecking order.” The plan was to gather everyone in a room with Jobs, and then\nthe CFO would come in a few minutes late to establish that he was the person running\nthe meeting. “But a funny thing happened,” Catmull recalled. “Steve started the meeting\non time without the CFO, and by the time the CFO walked in Steve was already in\ncontrol of the meeting.”\nJobs met only once with George Lucas, who warned him that the people in the\ndivision  cared  more  about  making  animated  movies  than  they  did  about  making\ncomputers. “You know, these guys are hell-bent on animation,” Lucas told him. Lucas\nlater recalled, “I did warn him that was basically Ed and John’s agenda. I think in his\nheart he bought the company because that was his agenda too.”\nThe final agreement was reached in January 1986. It provided that, for his $10\nmillion investment, Jobs would own 70% of the company, with the rest of the stock\ndistributed  to  Ed  Catmull,  Alvy  Ray  Smith,  and  the  thirty-eight  other  founding\nemployees, down to the receptionist. The division’s most important piece of hardware\nwas called the Pixar Image Computer, and from it the new company took its name.\nFor a while Jobs let Catmull and Smith run Pixar without much interference. Every\nmonth or so they would gather for a board meeting, usually at NeXT headquarters,\nwhere  Jobs  would  focus  on  the  finances  and  strategy.  Nevertheless,  by  dint  of  his\npersonality and controlling instincts, Jobs was soon playing a stronger role. He spewed\nout a stream of ideas—some reasonable, others wacky—about what Pixar’s hardware\nand software could become. And on his occasional visits to the Pixar offices, he was an\n\ninspiring presence. “I grew up a Southern Baptist, and we had revival meetings with\nmesmerizing but corrupt preachers,” recounted Alvy Ray Smith. “Steve’s got it: the\npower of the tongue and the web of words that catches people up. We were aware of\nthis when we had board meetings, so we developed signals—nose scratching or ear\ntugs—for when someone had been caught up in Steve’s distortion field and he needed to\nbe tugged back to reality.”\nJobs had always appreciated the virtue of integrating hardware and software, which\nis what Pixar did with its Image Computer and rendering software. It also produced\ncreative content, such as animated films and graphics. All three elements benefited from\nJobs’s combination of artistic creativity and technological geekiness. “Silicon Valley\nfolks don’t really respect Hollywood creative types, and the Hollywood folks think that\ntech folks are people you hire and never have to meet,” Jobs later said. “Pixar was one\nplace where both cultures were respected.”\nInitially the revenue was supposed to come from the hardware side. The Pixar Image\nComputer  sold  for  $125,000.  The  primary  customers  were  animators  and  graphic\ndesigners, but the machine also soon found specialized markets in the medical industry\n(CAT  scan  data  could  be  rendered  in  three-dimensional  graphics)  and  intelligence\nfields (for rendering information from reconnaissance flights and satellites). Because of\nthe sales to the National Security Agency, Jobs had to get a security clearance, which\nmust have been fun for the FBI agent assigned to vet him. At one point, a Pixar executive\nrecalled, Jobs was called by the investigator to go over the drug use questions, which\nhe answered unabashedly. “The last time I used that ...,” he would say, or on occasion\nhe would answer that no, he had actually never tried that particular drug.\nJobs pushed Pixar to build a lower-cost version of the computer that would sell for\naround  $30,000.  He  insisted  that  Hartmut  Esslinger  design  it,  despite  protests  by\nCatmull and Smith about his fees. It ended up looking like the original Pixar Image\nComputer, which was a cube with a round dimple in the middle, but it had Esslinger’s\nsignature thin grooves.\nJobs wanted to sell Pixar’s computers to a mass market, so he had the Pixar folks\nopen up sales offices—for which he approved the design—in major cities, on the theory\nthat creative people would soon come up with all sorts of ways to use the machine. “My\nview is that people are creative animals and will figure out clever new ways to use\ntools that the inventor never imagined,” he later said. “I thought that would happen with\nthe Pixar computer, just as it did with the Mac.” But the machine never took hold with\nregular consumers. It cost too much, and there were not many software programs for it.\nOn the software side, Pixar had a rendering program, known as Reyes (Renders\neverything you ever saw), for making 3-D graphics and images. After Jobs became\nchairman, the company created a new language and interface, named RenderMan, that it\nhoped would become a standard for 3-D graphics rendering, just as Adobe’s PostScript\nwas for laser printing.\n\nAs he had with the hardware, Jobs decided that they should try to find a mass\nmarket, rather than just a specialized one, for the software they made. He was never\ncontent to aim only at the corporate or high-end specialized markets. “He would have\nthese great visions of how RenderMan could be for everyman,” recalled Pam Kerwin,\nPixar’s marketing director. “He kept coming up with ideas about how ordinary people\nwould use it to make amazing 3-D graphics and photorealistic images.” The Pixar team\nwould try to dissuade him by saying that RenderMan was not as easy to use as, say,\nExcel or Adobe Illustrator. Then Jobs would go to a whiteboard and show them how to\nmake it simpler and more user-friendly. “We would be nodding our heads and getting\nexcited and say, ‘Yes, yes, this will be great!’” Kerwin recalled. “And then he would\nleave and we would consider it for a moment and then say, ‘What the heck was he\nthinking!’ He was so weirdly charismatic that you almost had to get deprogrammed after\nyou talked to him.” As it turned out, average consumers were not craving expensive\nsoftware that would let them render realistic images. RenderMan didn’t take off.\nThere  was,  however,  one  company  that  was  eager  to  automate  the  rendering  of\nanimators’  drawings  into  color  images  for  film.  When  Roy  Disney  led  a  board\nrevolution at the company that his uncle Walt had founded, the new CEO, Michael\nEisner,  asked  what  role  he  wanted.  Disney  said  that  he  would  like  to  revive  the\ncompany’s venerable but fading animation department. One of his first initiatives was to\nlook  at  ways  to  computerize  the  process,  and  Pixar  won  the  contract.  It  created  a\npackage of customized hardware and software known as CAPS, Computer Animation\nProduction System. It was first used in 1988 for the final scene of The Little Mermaid,\nin which King Triton waves goodbye to Ariel. Disney bought dozens of Pixar Image\nComputers as CAPS became an integral part of its production.\nAnimation\nThe digital animation business at Pixar—the group that made little animated films—was\noriginally just a sideline, its main purpose being to show off the hardware and software\nof the company. It was run by John Lasseter, a man whose childlike face and demeanor\nmasked an artistic perfectionism that rivaled that of Jobs. Born in Hollywood, Lasseter\ngrew up loving Saturday morning cartoon shows. In ninth grade, he wrote a report on\nthe history of Disney Studios, and he decided then how he wished to spend his life.\nWhen he graduated from high school, Lasseter enrolled in the animation program at\nthe California Institute of the Arts, founded by Walt Disney. In his summers and spare\ntime, he researched the Disney archives and worked as a guide on the Jungle Cruise\nride at Disneyland. The latter experience taught him the value of timing and pacing in\ntelling a story, an important but difficult concept to master when creating, frame by\nframe, animated footage. He won the Student Academy Award for the short he made in\n\nhis  junior  year, Lady  and  the  Lamp,  which  showed  his  debt  to  Disney  films  and\nforeshadowed his signature talent for infusing inanimate objects such as lamps with\nhuman personalities. After graduation he took the job for which he was destined: as an\nanimator at Disney Studios.\nExcept it didn’t work out. “Some of us younger guys wanted to bring Star  Wars–\nlevel quality to the art of animation, but we were held in check,” Lasseter recalled. “I\ngot  disillusioned,  then  I  got  caught  in  a  feud  between  two  bosses,  and  the  head\nanimation guy fired me.” So in 1984 Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith were able to\nrecruit him to work where Star Wars–level quality was being defined, Lucasfilm. It was\nnot certain that George Lucas, already worried about the cost of his computer division,\nwould really approve of hiring a full-time animator, so Lasseter was given the title\n“interface designer.”\nAfter Jobs came onto the scene, he and Lasseter began to share their passion for\ngraphic design. “I was the only guy at Pixar who was an artist, so I bonded with Steve\nover his design sense,” Lasseter said. He was a gregarious, playful, and huggable man\nwho wore flowery Hawaiian shirts, kept his office cluttered with vintage toys, and\nloved cheeseburgers. Jobs was a prickly, whip-thin vegetarian who favored austere and\nuncluttered surroundings. But they were actually well-suited for each other. Lasseter\nwas an artist, so Jobs treated him deferentially, and Lasseter viewed Jobs, correctly, as\na patron who could appreciate artistry and knew how it could be interwoven with\ntechnology and commerce.\nJobs and Catmull decided that, in order to show off their hardware and software,\nLasseter  should  produce  another  short  animated  film  in  1986  for  SIGGRAPH,  the\nannual computer graphics conference. At the time, Lasseter was using the Luxo lamp on\nhis desk as a model for graphic rendering, and he decided to turn Luxo into a lifelike\ncharacter. A friend’s young child inspired him to add Luxo Jr., and he showed a few test\nframes to another animator, who urged him to make sure he told a story. Lasseter said he\nwas making only a short, but the animator reminded him that a story can be told even in\na few seconds. Lasseter took the lesson to heart. Luxo Jr. ended up being just over two\nminutes; it told the tale of a parent lamp and a child lamp pushing a ball back and forth\nuntil the ball bursts, to the child’s dismay.\nJobs was so excited that he took time off from the pressures at NeXT to fly down\nwith Lasseter to SIGGRAPH, which was being held in Dallas that August. “It was so\nhot and muggy that when we’d walk outside the air hit us like a tennis racket,” Lasseter\nrecalled. There were ten thousand people at the trade show, and Jobs loved it. Artistic\ncreativity energized him, especially when it was connected to technology.\nThere  was  a  long  line  to  get into  the  auditorium  where  the  films  were  being\nscreened, so Jobs, not one to wait his turn, fast-talked their way in first. Luxo Jr. got a\nprolonged standing ovation and was named the best film. “Oh, wow!” Jobs exclaimed at\nthe end. “I really get this, I get what it’s all about.” As he later explained, “Our film was\n\nthe only one that had art to it, not just good technology. Pixar was about making that\ncombination, just as the Macintosh had been.”\nLuxo  Jr.  was  nominated  for  an  Academy  Award,  and  Jobs  flew  down  to  Los\nAngeles to be there for the ceremony. It didn’t win, but Jobs became committed to\nmaking new animated shorts each year, even though there was not much of a business\nrationale for doing so. As times got tough at Pixar, he would sit through brutal budget-\ncutting meetings showing no mercy. Then Lasseter would ask that the money they had\njust saved be used for his next film, and Jobs would agree.\nTin Toy\nNot all of Jobs’s relationships at Pixar were as good. His worst clash came with\nCatmull’s cofounder, Alvy Ray Smith. From a Baptist background in rural north Texas,\nSmith became a free-spirited hippie computer imaging engineer with a big build, big\nlaugh, and big personality—and occasionally an ego to match. “Alvy just glows, with a\nhigh color, friendly laugh, and a whole bunch of groupies at conferences,” said Pam\nKerwin. “A personality like Alvy’s was likely to ruffle Steve. They are both visionaries\nand high energy and high ego. Alvy is not as willing to make peace and overlook things\nas Ed was.”\nSmith saw Jobs as someone whose charisma and ego led him to abuse power. “He\nwas like a televangelist,” Smith said. “He wanted to control people, but I would not be\na slave to him, which is why we clashed. Ed was much more able to go with the flow.”\nJobs  would  sometimes  assert  his  dominance  at  a  meeting  by  saying  something\noutrageous or untrue. Smith took great joy in calling him on it, and he would do so with\na large laugh and a smirk. This did not endear him to Jobs.\nOne  day  at  a  board  meeting,  Jobs  started  berating  Smith  and  other  top  Pixar\nexecutives for the delay in getting the circuit boards completed for the new version of\nthe Pixar Image Computer. At the time, NeXT was also very late in completing its own\ncomputer boards, and Smith pointed that out: “Hey, you’re even later with your NeXT\nboards,  so  quit  jumping  on  us.”  Jobs  went  ballistic,  or  in  Smith’s  phrase,  “totally\nnonlinear.” When Smith was feeling attacked or confrontational, he tended to lapse into\nhis southwestern accent. Jobs started parodying it in his sarcastic style. “It was a bully\ntactic, and I exploded with everything I had,” Smith recalled. “Before I knew it, we\nwere in each other’s faces—about three inches apart—screaming at each other.”\nJobs was very possessive about control of the whiteboard during a meeting, so the\nburly Smith pushed past him and started writing on it. “You can’t do that!” Jobs shouted.\n“What?” responded Smith, “I can’t write on your whiteboard? Bullshit.” At that\npoint Jobs stormed out.\n\nSmith  eventually  resigned  to  form  a  new  company  to  make  software  for  digital\ndrawing and image editing. Jobs refused him permission to use some code he had\ncreated while at Pixar, which further inflamed their enmity. “Alvy eventually got what\nhe needed,” said Catmull, “but he was very stressed for a year and developed a lung\ninfection.” In the end it worked out well enough; Microsoft eventually bought Smith’s\ncompany, giving him the distinction of being a founder of one company that was sold to\nJobs and another that was sold to Gates.\nOrnery in the best of times, Jobs became particularly so when it became clear that\nall  three  Pixar  endeavors—hardware,  software,  and  animated  content—were  losing\nmoney. “I’d get these plans, and in the end I kept having to put in more money,” he\nrecalled. He would rail, but then write the check. Having been ousted at Apple and\nflailing at NeXT, he couldn’t afford a third strike.\nTo stem the losses, he ordered a round of deep layoffs, which he executed with his\ntypical empathy deficiency. As Pam Kerwin put it, he had “neither the emotional nor\nfinancial runway to be decent to people he was letting go.” Jobs insisted that the firings\nbe done immediately, with no severance pay. Kerwin took Jobs on a walk around the\nparking lot and begged that the employees be given at least two weeks notice. “Okay,”\nhe  shot  back,  “but  the  notice  is  retroactive  from  two  weeks  ago.”  Catmull  was  in\nMoscow, and Kerwin put in frantic calls to him. When he returned, he was able to\ninstitute a meager severance plan and calm things down just a bit.\nAt one point the members of the Pixar animation team were trying to convince Intel\nto  let  them  make  some  of  its  commercials,  and  Jobs  became  impatient.  During  a\nmeeting, in the midst of berating an Intel marketing director, he picked up the phone and\ncalled CEO Andy Grove directly. Grove, still playing mentor, tried to teach Jobs a\nlesson: He supported his Intel manager. “I stuck by my employee,” he recalled. “Steve\ndoesn’t like to be treated like a supplier.”\nGrove also played mentor when Jobs proposed that Pixar give Intel suggestions on\nhow  to  improve  the  capacity  of  its  processors  to  render  3-D  graphics.  When  the\nengineers at Intel accepted the offer, Jobs sent an email back saying Pixar would need to\nbe paid for its advice. Intel’s chief engineer replied, “We have not entered into any\nfinancial arrangement in exchange for good ideas for our microprocessors in the past\nand have no intention for the future.” Jobs forwarded the answer to Grove, saying that\nhe  found  the  engineer’s  response  to  be  “extremely  arrogant,  given  Intel’s  dismal\nshowing in understanding computer graphics.” Grove sent Jobs a blistering reply, saying\nthat sharing ideas is “what friendly companies and friends do for each other.” Grove\nadded that he had often freely shared ideas with Jobs in the past and that Jobs should not\nbe so mercenary. Jobs relented. “I have many faults, but one of them is not ingratitude,”\nhe responded. “Therefore, I have changed my position 180 degrees—we will freely\nhelp. Thanks for the clearer perspective.”\n\nPixar was able to create some powerful software products aimed at average consumers,\nor at least those average consumers who shared Jobs’s passion for designing things.\nJobs still hoped that the ability to make super-realistic 3-D images at home would\nbecome part of the desktop publishing craze. Pixar’s Showplace, for example, allowed\nusers to change the shadings on the 3-D objects they created so that they could display\nthem from various angles with appropriate shadows. Jobs thought it was incredibly\ncompelling, but most consumers were content to live without it. It was a case where his\npassions misled him: The software had so many amazing features that it lacked the\nsimplicity Jobs usually demanded. Pixar couldn’t compete with Adobe, which was\nmaking software that was less sophisticated but far less complicated and expensive.\nEven  as  Pixar’s  hardware  and  software  product  lines  foundered,  Jobs  kept\nprotecting the animation group. It had become for him a little island of magical artistry\nthat gave him deep emotional pleasure, and he was willing to nurture it and bet on it. In\nthe spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting to decree deep\nspending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group\nwere almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another\nshort. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. It would\nrequire close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there\nwere  any  storyboards.  Catmull  took  him  down  to  the  animation  offices,  and  once\nLasseter  started  his  show—displaying  his  boards,  doing  the  voices,  showing  his\npassion for his product—Jobs started to warm up.\nThe story was about Lasseter’s love, classic toys. It was told from the perspective of\na toy one-man band named Tinny, who meets a baby that charms and terrorizes him.\nEscaping under the couch, Tinny finds other frightened toys, but when the baby hits his\nhead and cries, Tinny goes back out to cheer him up.\nJobs said he would provide the money. “I believed in what John was doing,” he later\nsaid. “It was art. He cared, and I cared. I always said yes.” His only comment at the end\nof Lasseter’s presentation was, “All I ask of you, John, is to make it great.”\nTin Toy went on to win the 1988 Academy Award for animated short films, the first\ncomputer-generated film to do so. To celebrate, Jobs took Lasseter and his team to\nGreens, a vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco. Lasseter grabbed the Oscar, which\nwas in the center of the table, held it aloft, and toasted Jobs by saying, “All you asked is\nthat we make a great movie.”\nThe new team at Disney—Michael Eisner the CEO and Jeffrey Katzenberg in the\nfilm division—began a quest to get Lasseter to come back. They liked Tin Toy, and they\nthought that something more could be done with animated stories of toys that come alive\nand have human emotions. But Lasseter, grateful for Jobs’s faith in him, felt that Pixar\nwas  the  only  place  where  he  could  create  a  new  world  of  computer-generated\nanimation. He told Catmull, “I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and\nmake history.” So Disney began talking about making a production deal with Pixar.\n“Lasseter’s  shorts  were  really  breathtaking  both  in  storytelling  and  in  the  use  of\n\ntechnology,” recalled Katzenberg. “I tried so hard to get him to Disney, but he was loyal\nto Steve and Pixar. So if you can’t beat them, join them. We decided to look for ways\nwe could join up with Pixar and have them make a film about toys for us.”\nBy this point Jobs had poured close to $50 million of his own money into Pixar—\nmore than half of what he had pocketed when he cashed out of Apple—and he was still\nlosing money at NeXT. He was hard-nosed about it; he forced all Pixar employees to\ngive up their options as part of his agreement to add another round of personal funding\nin 1991. But he was also a romantic in his love for what artistry and technology could\ndo together. His belief that ordinary consumers would love to do 3-D modeling on Pixar\nsoftware turned out to be wrong, but that was soon replaced by an instinct that turned\nout to be right: that combining great art and digital technology would transform animated\nfilms more than anything had since 1937, when Walt Disney had given life to Snow\nWhite.\nLooking  back,  Jobs  said  that,  had  he  known  more,  he  would  have  focused  on\nanimation sooner and not worried about pushing the company’s hardware or software\napplications. On the other hand, had he known the hardware and software would never\nbe profitable, he would not have taken over Pixar. “Life kind of snookered me into\ndoing that, and perhaps it was for the better.”\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY\nA REGULAR GUY\nLove Is Just a Four-Letter Word\nMona Simpson and her fiancé, Richard Appel, 1991\nJoan Baez\nIn 1982, when he was still working on the Macintosh, Jobs met the famed folksinger\nJoan Baez through her sister Mimi Fariña, who headed a charity that was trying to get\ndonations of computers for prisons, and through Mark Vermilion, who ran Baez’s human\nrights foundation Humanitas. When Jobs donated some computers to them, he asked if he\ncould meet Baez. A few weeks later he and Baez had lunch in Cupertino. “I wasn’t\nexpecting a lot, but she was really smart and funny,” he recalled. At the time, he was\nnearing  the  end  of  his  relationship  with  Barbara  Jasinski.  They  had  vacationed  in\nHawaii, shared a house in the Santa Cruz mountains, and even gone to one of Baez’s\nconcerts together. As his relationship with Jasinski flamed out, Jobs began getting more\n\nserious with Baez. He was twenty-seven and Baez was forty-one, but for a few years\nthey  had  a  romance.  “It  turned  into  a  serious  relationship  between  two  accidental\nfriends who became lovers,” Jobs recalled in a somewhat wistful tone.\nElizabeth Holmes, Jobs’s friend from Reed College, believed that one of the reasons\nhe went out with Baez—other than the fact that she was beautiful and funny and talented\n—was that she had once been the lover of Bob Dylan. “Steve loved that connection to\nDylan,” she later said. Baez and Dylan had been lovers in the early 1960s, and they\ntoured as friends after that, including with the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. (Jobs\nhad the bootlegs of those concerts.)\nWhen she met Jobs, Baez had a fourteen-year-old son, Gabriel, from her marriage to\nthe antiwar activist David Harris. At lunch she told Jobs she was trying to teach Gabe\nhow to type. “You mean on a typewriter?” Jobs asked. When she said yes, he replied,\n“But a typewriter is antiquated.”\n“If a typewriter is antiquated, what does that make me?” she asked. There was an\nawkward pause. As Baez later told me, “As soon as I said it, I realized the answer was\nso obvious. The question just hung in the air. I was just horrified.”\nMuch to the astonishment of the Macintosh team, Jobs burst into the office one day\nwith Baez and showed her the prototype of the Macintosh. They were dumbfounded that\nhe would reveal the computer to an outsider, given his obsession with secrecy, but they\nwere even more blown away to be in the presence of Joan Baez. He gave Gabe an\nApple II, and he later gave Baez a Macintosh. On visits Jobs would show off the\nfeatures he liked. “He was sweet and patient, but he was so advanced in his knowledge\nthat he had trouble teaching me,” she recalled.\nHe was a sudden multimillionaire; she was a world-famous celebrity, but sweetly\ndown-to-earth and not all that wealthy. She didn’t know what to make of him then, and\nstill found him puzzling when she talked about him almost thirty years later. At one\ndinner early in their relationship, Jobs started talking about Ralph Lauren and his Polo\nShop, which she admitted she had never visited. “There’s a beautiful red dress there\nthat would be perfect for you,” he said, and then drove her to the store in the Stanford\nMall. Baez recalled, “I said to myself, far out, terrific, I’m with one of the world’s\nrichest men and he wants me to have this beautiful dress.” When they got to the store,\nJobs bought a handful of shirts for himself and showed her the red dress. “You ought to\nbuy it,” he said. She was a little surprised, and told him she couldn’t really afford it. He\nsaid nothing, and they left. “Wouldn’t you think if someone had talked like that the whole\nevening, that they were going to get it for you?” she asked me, seeming genuinely\npuzzled about the incident. “The mystery of the red dress is in your hands. I felt a bit\nstrange about it.” He would give her computers, but not a dress, and when he brought\nher flowers he made sure to say they were left over from an event in the office. “He was\nboth romantic and afraid to be romantic,” she said.\nWhen he was working on the NeXT computer, he went to Baez’s house in Woodside\nto show her how well it could produce music. “He had it play a Brahms quartet, and he\n\ntold me eventually computers would sound better than humans playing it, even get the\ninnuendo and the cadences better,” Baez recalled. She was revolted by the idea. “He\nwas working himself up into a fervor of delight while I was shrinking into a rage and\nthinking, How could you defile music like that?”\nJobs would confide in Debi Coleman and Joanna Hoffman about his relationship\nwith Baez and worry about whether he could marry someone who had a teenage son and\nwas probably past the point of wanting to have more children. “At times he would\nbelittle her as being an ‘issues’ singer and not a true ‘political’ singer like Dylan,” said\nHoffman. “She was a strong woman, and he wanted to show he was in control. Plus, he\nalways said he wanted to have a family, and with her he knew that he wouldn’t.”\nAnd so, after about three years, they ended their romance and drifted into becoming\njust friends. “I thought I was in love with her, but I really just liked her a lot,” he later\nsaid. “We weren’t destined to be together. I wanted kids, and she didn’t want any\nmore.” In her 1989 memoir, Baez wrote about her breakup with her husband and why\nshe never remarried: “I belonged alone, which is how I have been since then, with\noccasional interruptions that are mostly picnics.” She did add a nice acknowledgment at\nthe end of the book to “Steve Jobs for forcing me to use a word processor by putting one\nin my kitchen.”\nFinding Joanne and Mona\nWhen Jobs was thirty-one, a year after his ouster from Apple, his mother Clara, who\nwas a smoker, was stricken with lung cancer. He spent time by her deathbed, talking to\nher in ways he had rarely done in the past and asking some questions he had refrained\nfrom raising before. “When you and Dad got married, were you a virgin?” he asked. It\nwas hard for her to talk, but she forced a smile. That’s when she told him that she had\nbeen married before, to a man who never made it back from the war. She also filled in\nsome of the details of how she and Paul Jobs had come to adopt him.\nSoon after that, Jobs succeeded in tracking down the woman who had put him up for\nadoption. His quiet quest to find her had begun in the early 1980s, when he hired a\ndetective who had failed to come up with anything. Then Jobs noticed the name of a San\nFrancisco doctor on his birth certificate. “He was in the phone book, so I gave him a\ncall,” Jobs recalled. The doctor was no help. He claimed that his records had been\ndestroyed in a fire. That was not true. In fact, right after Jobs called, the doctor wrote a\nletter, sealed it in an envelope, and wrote on it, “To be delivered to Steve Jobs on my\ndeath.” When he died a short time later, his widow sent the letter to Jobs. In it, the\ndoctor  explained  that  his  mother  had  been  an  unmarried  graduate  student  from\nWisconsin named Joanne Schieble.\n\nIt took another few weeks and the work of another detective to track her down. After\ngiving him up, Joanne had married his biological father, Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, and\nthey had another child, Mona. Jandali abandoned them five years later, and Joanne\nmarried a colorful ice-skating instructor, George Simpson. That marriage didn’t last\nlong either, and in 1970 she began a meandering journey that took her and Mona (both of\nthem now using the last name Simpson) to Los Angeles.\nJobs had been reluctant to let Paul and Clara, whom he considered his real parents,\nknow about his search for his birth mother. With a sensitivity that was unusual for him,\nand which showed the deep affection he felt for his parents, he worried that they might\nbe offended. So he never contacted Joanne Simpson until after Clara Jobs died in early\n1986. “I never wanted them to feel like I didn’t consider them my parents, because they\nwere totally my parents,” he recalled. “I loved them so much that I never wanted them to\nknow of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out.”\nWhen Clara died, he decided to tell Paul Jobs, who was perfectly comfortable and said\nhe didn’t mind at all if Steve made contact with his biological mother.\nSo one day Jobs called Joanne Simpson, said who he was, and arranged to come\ndown to Los Angeles to meet her. He later claimed it was mainly out of curiosity. “I\nbelieve in environment more than heredity in determining your traits, but still you have\nto wonder a little about your biological roots,” he said. He also wanted to reassure\nJoanne that what she had done was all right. “I wanted to meet my biological mother\nmostly to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I’m glad I didn’t end up as an\nabortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.”\nJoanne was overcome with emotion when Jobs arrived at her Los Angeles house.\nShe knew he was famous and rich, but she wasn’t exactly sure why. She immediately\nbegan to pour out her emotions. She had been pressured to sign the papers putting him\nup for adoption, she said, and did so only when told that he was happy in the house of\nhis new parents. She had always missed him and suffered about what she had done. She\napologized over and over, even as Jobs kept reassuring her that he understood, and that\nthings had turned out just fine.\nOnce she calmed down, she told Jobs that he had a full sister, Mona Simpson, who\nwas then an aspiring novelist in Manhattan. She had never told Mona that she had a\nbrother, and that day she broke the news, or at least part of it, by telephone. “You have a\nbrother, and he’s wonderful, and he’s famous, and I’m going to bring him to New York\nso you can meet him,” she said. Mona was in the throes of finishing a novel about her\nmother and their peregrination from Wisconsin to Los Angeles, Anywhere  but  Here.\nThose who’ve read it will not be surprised that Joanne was somewhat quirky in the way\nshe imparted to Mona the news about her brother. She refused to say who he was—only\nthat he had been poor, had gotten rich, was good-looking and famous, had long dark\nhair, and lived in California. Mona then worked at the Paris Review, George Plimpton’s\nliterary journal housed on the ground floor of his townhouse near Manhattan’s East\nRiver. She and her coworkers began a guessing game on who her brother might be. John\n\nTravolta? That was one of the favorite guesses. Other actors were also hot prospects.\nAt one point someone did toss out a guess that “maybe it’s one of those guys who started\nApple computer,” but no one could recall their names.\nThe  meeting  occurred  in  the  lobby of  the  St.  Regis  Hotel.  “He  was  totally\nstraightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy,” Mona recalled. They all sat\nand talked for a few minutes, then he took his sister for a long walk, just the two of\nthem. Jobs was thrilled to find that he had a sibling who was so similar to him. They\nwere both intense in their artistry, observant of their surroundings, and sensitive yet\nstrong-willed. When they went to dinner together, they noticed the same architectural\ndetails and talked about them excitedly afterward. “My sister’s a writer!” he exulted to\ncolleagues at Apple when he found out.\nWhen Plimpton threw a party for Anywhere but Here in late 1986, Jobs flew to New\nYork to accompany Mona to it. They grew increasingly close, though their friendship\nhad the complexities that might be expected, considering who they were and how they\nhad come together. “Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and\nhave her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me,” he later said. “As we got to\nknow each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don’t know\nwhat I’d do without her. I can’t imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I\nwere never close.” Mona likewise developed a deep affection for him, and at times\ncould be very protective, although she would later write an edgy novel about him, A\nRegular Guy, that described his quirks with discomforting accuracy.\nOne of the few things they would argue about was her clothes. She dressed like a\nstruggling novelist, and he would berate her for not wearing clothes that were “fetching\nenough.” At one point his comments so annoyed her that she wrote him a letter: “I am a\nyoung writer, and this is my life, and I’m not trying to be a model anyway.” He didn’t\nanswer. But shortly after, a box arrived from the store of Issey Miyake, the Japanese\nfashion designer whose stark and technology-influenced style made him one of Jobs’s\nfavorites. “He’d gone shopping for me,” she later said, “and he’d picked out great\nthings,  exactly  my  size,  in  flattering  colors.”  There  was  one  pantsuit  that  he  had\nparticularly  liked,  and  the  shipment  included  three  of  them,  all  identical.  “I  still\nremember those first suits I sent Mona,” he said. “They were linen pants and tops in a\npale grayish green that looked beautiful with her reddish hair.”\nThe Lost Father\nIn the meantime, Mona Simpson had been trying to track down their father, who had\nwandered off when she was five. Through Ken Auletta and Nick Pileggi, prominent\nManhattan writers, she was introduced to a retired New York cop who had formed his\nown detective agency. “I paid him what little money I had,” Simpson recalled, but the\n\nsearch was unsuccessful. Then she met another private eye in California, who was able\nto find an address for Abdulfattah Jandali in Sacramento through a Department of Motor\nVehicles search. Simpson told her brother and flew out from New York to see the man\nwho was apparently their father.\nJobs had no interest in meeting him. “He didn’t treat me well,” he later explained. “I\ndon’t hold anything against him—I’m happy to be alive. But what bothers me most is\nthat he didn’t treat Mona well. He abandoned her.” Jobs himself had abandoned his own\nillegitimate daughter, Lisa, and now was trying to restore their relationship, but that\ncomplexity did not soften his feelings toward Jandali. Simpson went to Sacramento\nalone.\n“It was very intense,” Simpson recalled. She found her father working in a small\nrestaurant. He seemed happy to see her, yet oddly passive about the entire situation.\nThey talked for a few hours, and he recounted that, after he left Wisconsin, he had\ndrifted away from teaching and gotten into the restaurant business.\nJobs had asked Simpson not to mention him, so she didn’t. But at one point her father\ncasually remarked that he and her mother had had another baby, a boy, before she had\nbeen born. “What happened to him?” she asked. He replied, “We’ll never see that baby\nagain. That baby’s gone.” Simpson recoiled but said nothing.\nAn  even  more  astonishing  revelation  occurred  when  Jandali  was  describing  the\nprevious restaurants that he had run. There had been some nice ones, he insisted, fancier\nthan the Sacramento joint they were then sitting in. He told her, somewhat emotionally,\nthat  he  wished  she  could  have  seen  him  when  he  was  managing  a  Mediterranean\nrestaurant  north  of  San  Jose.  “That  was  a  wonderful  place,”  he  said.  “All  of  the\nsuccessful  technology  people  used  to  come  there. Even  Steve  Jobs.”  Simpson  was\nstunned. “Oh, yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy, and a big tipper,” her\nfather added. Mona was able to refrain from blurting out, Steve Jobs is your son!\nWhen the visit was over, she called Jobs surreptitiously from the pay phone at the\nrestaurant and arranged to meet him at the Espresso Roma café in Berkeley. Adding to\nthe personal and family drama, he brought along Lisa, now in grade school, who lived\nwith her mother, Chrisann. When they all arrived at the café, it was close to 10 p.m.,\nand  Simpson  poured  forth  the  tale.  Jobs  was  understandably  astonished  when  she\nmentioned the restaurant near San Jose. He could recall being there and even meeting\nthe man who was his biological father. “It was amazing,” he later said of the revelation.\n“I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was\nSyrian. Balding. We shook hands.”\nNevertheless Jobs still had no desire to see him. “I was a wealthy man by then, and I\ndidn’t trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it,” he recalled,\nsomewhat unfairly as he did not know Jandali. “I asked Mona not to tell him about me.”\nShe never did, but years later Jandali saw his relationship to Jobs mentioned online.\n(A blogger noticed that Simpson had listed Jandali as her father in a reference book and\nfigured out he must be Jobs’s father as well.) By then Jandali was married for a fourth\n\ntime and working as a food and beverage manager at the Boomtown Resort and Casino\njust west of Reno, Nevada. When he brought his new wife, Roscille, to visit Simpson in\n2006,  he  raised  the  topic.  “What  is  this  thing  about  Steve  Jobs?”  he  asked.  She\nconfirmed the story, but added that she thought Jobs had no interest in meeting him.\nJandali seemed to accept that. “My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he\nis very, very passive,” Simpson said. “He never contacted Steve.”\nSimpson turned her search for Jandali into a basis for her second novel, The  Lost\nFather, published in 1992. (Jobs convinced Paul Rand, the designer who did the NeXT\nlogo, to design the cover, but according to Simpson, “It was God-awful and we never\nused it.”) She also tracked down various members of the Jandali family, in Homs and in\nAmerica,  and  in  2011  was  writing  a  novel  about  her  Syrian  roots.  The  Syrian\nambassador in Washington threw a dinner for her that included a cousin and his wife\nwho then lived in Florida and had flown up for the occasion.\nSimpson assumed that Jobs would eventually meet Jandali, but as time went on he\nshowed even less interest. In 2010, when Jobs and his son, Reed, went to a birthday\ndinner for Simpson at her Los Angeles house, Reed spent some time looking at pictures\nof his biological grandfather, but Jobs ignored them. Nor did he seem to care about his\nSyrian heritage. When the Middle East would come up in conversation, the topic did not\nengage him or evoke his typical strong opinions, even after Syria was swept up in the\n2011 Arab Spring uprisings. “I don’t think anybody really knows what we should be\ndoing over there,” he said when I asked whether the Obama administration should be\nintervening more in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. “You’re fucked if you do and you’re fucked\nif you don’t.”\nJobs did retain a friendly relationship with his biological mother, Joanne Simpson.\nOver the years she and Mona would often spend Christmas at Jobs’s house. The visits\ncould be sweet, but also emotionally draining. Joanne would sometimes break into\ntears, say how much she had loved him, and apologize for giving him up. It turned out\nall right, Jobs would reassure her. As he told her one Christmas, “Don’t worry. I had a\ngreat childhood. I turned out okay.”\nLisa\nLisa Brennan, however, did not have a great childhood. When she was young, her father\nalmost never came to see her. “I didn’t want to be a father, so I wasn’t,” Jobs later said,\nwith only a touch of remorse in his voice. Yet occasionally he felt the tug. One day,\nwhen  Lisa  was  three,  Jobs  was  driving  near  the  house  he  had  bought  for  her  and\nChrisann, and he decided to stop. Lisa didn’t know who he was. He sat on the doorstep,\nnot venturing inside, and talked to Chrisann. The scene was repeated once or twice a\n\nyear. Jobs would come by unannounced, talk a little bit about Lisa’s school options or\nother issues, then drive off in his Mercedes.\nBut by the time Lisa turned eight, in 1986, the visits were occurring more frequently.\nJobs was no longer immersed in the grueling push to create the Macintosh or in the\nsubsequent  power  struggles  with  Sculley.  He  was  at  NeXT,  which  was  calmer,\nfriendlier, and headquartered in Palo Alto, near where Chrisann and Lisa lived. In\naddition, by the time she was in third grade, it was clear that Lisa was a smart and\nartistic kid, who had already been singled out by her teachers for her writing ability.\nShe was spunky and high-spirited and had a little of her father’s defiant attitude. She\nalso  looked  a  bit  like  him,  with  arched  eyebrows  and  a  faintly  Middle  Eastern\nangularity. One day, to the surprise of his colleagues, he brought her by the office. As\nshe turned cartwheels in the corridor, she squealed, “Look at me!”\nAvie Tevanian, a lanky and gregarious engineer at NeXT who had become Jobs’s\nfriend, remembers that every now and then, when they were going out to dinner, they\nwould stop by Chrisann’s house to pick up Lisa. “He was very sweet to her,” Tevanian\nrecalled. “He was a vegetarian, and so was Chrisann, but she wasn’t. He was fine with\nthat. He suggested she order chicken, and she did.”\nEating chicken became her little indulgence as she shuttled between two parents who\nwere vegetarians with a spiritual regard for natural foods. “We bought our groceries—\nour puntarella, quinoa, celeriac, carob-covered nuts—in yeasty-smelling stores where\nthe women didn’t dye their hair,” she later wrote about her time with her mother. “But\nwe sometimes tasted foreign treats. A few times we bought a hot, seasoned chicken\nfrom a gourmet shop with rows and rows of chickens turning on spits, and ate it in the\ncar from the foil-lined paper bag with our fingers.” Her father, whose dietary fixations\ncame in fanatic waves, was more fastidious about what he ate. She watched him spit out\na mouthful of soup one day after learning that it contained butter. After loosening up a\nbit while at Apple, he was back to being a strict vegan. Even at a young age Lisa began\nto realize his diet obsessions reflected a life philosophy, one in which asceticism and\nminimalism  could  heighten  subsequent  sensations.  “He  believed  that  great  harvests\ncame from arid sources, pleasure from restraint,” she noted. “He knew the equations\nthat most people didn’t know: Things led to their opposites.”\nIn  a  similar  way,  the  absence  and  coldness  of  her  father  made  his  occasional\nmoments of warmth so much more intensely gratifying. “I didn’t live with him, but he\nwould stop by our house some days, a deity among us for a few tingling moments or\nhours,” she recalled. Lisa soon became interesting enough that he would take walks\nwith her. He would also go rollerblading with her on the quiet streets of old Palo Alto,\noften stopping at the houses of Joanna Hoffman and Andy Hertzfeld. The first time he\nbrought her around to see Hoffman, he just knocked on the door and announced, “This is\nLisa.” Hoffman knew right away. “It was obvious she was his daughter,” she told me.\n“Nobody has that jaw. It’s a signature jaw.” Hoffman, who suffered from not knowing\n\nher own divorced father until she was ten, encouraged Jobs to be a better father. He\nfollowed her advice, and later thanked her for it.\nOnce he took Lisa on a business trip to Tokyo, and they stayed at the sleek and\nbusinesslike Okura Hotel. At the elegant downstairs sushi bar, Jobs ordered large trays\nof unagi sushi, a dish he loved so much that he allowed the warm cooked eel to pass\nmuster as vegetarian. The pieces were coated with fine salt or a thin sweet sauce, and\nLisa  remembered  later  how  they  dissolved  in  her  mouth.  So,  too,  did  the  distance\nbetween them. As she later wrote, “It was the first time I’d felt, with him, so relaxed\nand content, over those trays of meat; the excess, the permission and warmth after the\ncold salads, meant a once inaccessible space had opened. He was less rigid with\nhimself, even human under the great ceilings with the little chairs, with the meat, and\nme.”\nBut it was not always sweetness and light. Jobs was as mercurial with Lisa as he\nwas with almost everyone, cycling between embrace and abandonment. On one visit he\nwould be playful; on the next he would be cold; often he was not there at all. “She was\nalways unsure of their relationship,” according to Hertzfeld. “I went to a birthday party\nof hers, and Steve was supposed to come, and he was very, very, late. She got extremely\nanxious and disappointed. But when he finally did come, she totally lit up.”\nLisa learned to be temperamental in return. Over the years their relationship would\nbe a roller coaster, with each of the low points elongated by their shared stubbornness.\nAfter a falling-out, they could go for months not speaking to each other. Neither one was\ngood at reaching out, apologizing, or making the effort to heal, even when he was\nwrestling with repeated health problems. One day in the fall of 2010 he was wistfully\ngoing through a box of old snapshots with me, and paused over one that showed him\nvisiting Lisa when she was young. “I probably didn’t go over there enough,” he said.\nSince he had not spoken to her all that year, I asked if he might want to reach out to her\nwith a call or email. He looked at me blankly for a moment, then went back to riffling\nthrough other old photographs.\nThe Romantic\nWhen it came to women, Jobs could be deeply romantic. He tended to fall in love\ndramatically, share with friends every up and down of a relationship, and pine in public\nwhenever he was away from his current girlfriend. In the summer of 1983 he went to a\nsmall dinner party in Silicon Valley with Joan Baez and sat next to an undergraduate at\nthe University of Pennsylvania named Jennifer Egan, who was not quite sure who he\nwas. By then he and Baez had realized that they weren’t destined to be forever young\ntogether,  and  Jobs  found  himself  fascinated  by  Egan,  who  was  working  on  a  San\nFrancisco weekly during her summer vacation. He tracked her down, gave her a call,\n\nand took her to Café Jacqueline, a little bistro near Telegraph Hill that specialized in\nvegetarian soufflés.\nThey dated for a year, and Jobs often flew east to visit her. At a Boston Macworld\nevent, he told a large gathering how much in love he was and thus needed to rush out to\ncatch a plane for Philadelphia to see his girlfriend. The audience was enchanted. When\nhe was visiting New York, she would take the train up to stay with him at the Carlyle or\nat Jay Chiat’s Upper East Side apartment, and they would eat at Café Luxembourg, visit\n(repeatedly) the apartment in the San Remo he was planning to remodel, and go to\nmovies or (once at least) the opera.\nHe and Egan also spoke for hours on the phone many nights. One topic they wrestled\nwith was his belief, which came from his Buddhist studies, that it was important to\navoid attachment to material objects. Our consumer desires are unhealthy, he told her,\nand  to  attain  enlightenment  you  need  to  develop  a  life  of  nonattachment  and\nnonmaterialism. He even sent her a tape of Kobun Chino, his Zen teacher, lecturing\nabout the problems caused by craving and obtaining things. Egan pushed back. Wasn’t\nhe defying that philosophy, she asked, by making computers and other products that\npeople coveted? “He was irritated by the dichotomy, and we had exuberant debates\nabout it,” Egan recalled.\nIn the end Jobs’s pride in the objects he made overcame his sensibility that people\nshould eschew being attached to such possessions. When the Macintosh came out in\nJanuary 1984, Egan was staying at her mother’s apartment in San Francisco during her\nwinter break from Penn. Her mother’s dinner guests were astonished one night when\nSteve Jobs—suddenly very famous—appeared at the door carrying a freshly boxed\nMacintosh and proceeded to Egan’s bedroom to set it up.\nJobs told Egan, as he had a few other friends, about his premonition that he would\nnot live a long life. That was why he was driven and impatient, he confided. “He felt a\nsense of urgency about all he wanted to get done,” Egan later said. Their relationship\ntapered off by the fall of 1984, when Egan made it clear that she was still far too young\nto think of getting married.\nShortly after that, just as the turmoil with Sculley was beginning to build at Apple in\nearly 1985, Jobs was heading to a meeting when he stopped at the office of a guy who\nwas  working  with  the  Apple  Foundation,  which  helped  get  computers  to  nonprofit\norganizations. Sitting in his office was a lithe, very blond woman who combined a\nhippie aura of natural purity with the solid sensibilities of a computer consultant. Her\nname  was  Tina  Redse.  “She  was  the  most  beautiful  woman  I’d  ever  seen,”  Jobs\nrecalled.\nHe called her the next day and asked her to dinner. She said no, that she was living\nwith a boyfriend. A few days later he took her on a walk to a nearby park and again\nasked her out, and this time she told her boyfriend that she wanted to go. She was very\n\nhonest and open. After dinner she started to cry because she knew her life was about to\nbe disrupted. And it was. Within a few months she had moved into the unfurnished\nmansion in Woodside. “She was the first person I was truly in love with,” Jobs later\nsaid. “We had a very deep connection. I don’t know that anyone will ever understand\nme better than she did.”\nRedse came from a troubled family, and Jobs shared with her his own pain about\nbeing  put  up  for  adoption.  “We  were  both  wounded  from  our  childhood,”  Redse\nrecalled. “He said to me that we were misfits, which is why we belonged together.”\nThey were physically passionate and prone to public displays of affection; their make-\nout sessions in the NeXT lobby are well remembered by employees. So too were their\nfights, which occurred at movie theaters and in front of visitors to Woodside. Yet he\nconstantly praised her purity and naturalness. As the well-grounded Joanna Hoffman\npointed out when discussing Jobs’s infatuation with the otherworldly Redse, “Steve had\na  tendency  to  look  at  vulnerabilities  and  neuroses  and  turn  them  into  spiritual\nattributes.”\nWhen he was being eased out at Apple in 1985, Redse traveled with him in Europe,\nwhere he was salving his wounds. Standing on a bridge over the Seine one evening,\nthey bandied about the idea, more romantic than serious, of just staying in France,\nmaybe settling down, perhaps indefinitely. Redse was eager, but Jobs didn’t want to. He\nwas burned but still ambitious. “I am a reflection of what I do,” he told her. She\nrecalled their Paris moment in a poignant email she sent to him twenty-five years later,\nafter they had gone their separate ways but retained their spiritual connection:\nWe were on a bridge in Paris in the summer of 1985. It was overcast. We leaned against\nthe smooth stone rail and stared at the green water rolling on below. Your world had\ncleaved and then it paused, waiting to rearrange itself around whatever you chose next. I\nwanted to run away from what had come before. I tried to convince you to begin a new\nlife with me in Paris, to shed our former selves and let something else course through\nus. I wanted us to crawl through that black chasm of your broken world and emerge,\nanonymous and new, in simple lives where I could cook you simple dinners and we\ncould be together every day, like children playing a sweet game with no purpose save\nthe game itself. I like to think you considered it before you laughed and said “What\ncould  I  do?  I’ve  made  myself  unemployable.”  I  like  to  think  that  in  that  moment’s\nhesitation before our bold futures reclaimed us, we lived that simple life together all the\nway into our peaceful old ages, with a brood of grandchildren around us on a farm in\nthe south of France, quietly going about our days, warm and complete like loaves of\nfresh bread, our small world filled with the aroma of patience and familiarity.\n\nThe relationship lurched up and down for five years. Redse hated living in his\nsparsely furnished Woodside house. Jobs had hired a hip young couple, who had once\nworked at Chez Panisse, as housekeepers and vegetarian cooks, and they made her feel\nlike an interloper. She would occasionally move out to an apartment of her own in Palo\nAlto, especially after one of her torrential arguments with Jobs. “Neglect is a form of\nabuse,”  she  once  scrawled  on  the  wall  of  the  hallway  to  their  bedroom.  She  was\nentranced by him, but she was also baffled by how uncaring he could be. She would\nlater recall how incredibly painful it was to be in love with someone so self-centered.\nCaring deeply about someone who seemed incapable of caring was a particular kind of\nhell that she wouldn’t wish on anyone, she said.\nThey were different in so many ways. “On the spectrum of cruel to kind, they are\nclose to the opposite poles,” Hertzfeld later said. Redse’s kindness was manifest in\nways large and small; she always gave money to street people, she volunteered to help\nthose who (like her father) were afflicted with mental illness, and she took care to make\nLisa  and  even  Chrisann  feel  comfortable  with  her.  More  than  anyone,  she  helped\npersuade Jobs to spend more time with Lisa. But she lacked Jobs’s ambition and drive.\nThe ethereal quality that made her seem so spiritual to Jobs also made it hard for them\nto stay on the same wavelength. “Their relationship was incredibly tempestuous,” said\nHertzfeld. “Because of both of their characters, they would have lots and lots of fights.”\nThey also had a basic philosophical difference about whether aesthetic tastes were\nfundamentally individual, as Redse believed, or universal and could be taught, as Jobs\nbelieved. She accused him of being too influenced by the Bauhaus movement. “Steve\nbelieved it was our job to teach people aesthetics, to teach people what they should\nlike,” she recalled. “I don’t share that perspective. I believe when we listen deeply,\nboth within ourselves and to each other, we are able to allow what’s innate and true to\nemerge.”\nWhen they were together for a long stretch, things did not work out well. But when\nthey were apart, Jobs would pine for her. Finally, in the summer of 1989, he asked her\nto marry him. She couldn’t do it. It would drive her crazy, she told friends. She had\ngrown  up  in  a  volatile  household,  and  her  relationship  with  Jobs  bore  too  many\nsimilarities to that environment. They were opposites who attracted, she said, but the\ncombination was too combustible. “I could not have been a good wife to ‘Steve Jobs,’\nthe  icon,”  she  later  explained.  “I  would  have  sucked  at  it  on  many  levels.  In  our\npersonal interactions, I couldn’t abide his unkindness. I didn’t want to hurt him, yet I\ndidn’t want to stand by and watch him hurt other people either. It was painful and\nexhausting.”\nAfter  they  broke  up,  Redse  helped  found  OpenMind,  a  mental  health  resource\nnetwork in California. She happened to read in a psychiatric manual about Narcissistic\nPersonality Disorder and decided that Jobs perfectly met the criteria. “It fits so well\nand explained so much of what we had struggled with, that I realized expecting him to\nbe nicer or less self-centered was like expecting a blind man to see,” she said. “It also\n\nexplained some of the choices he’d made about his daughter Lisa at that time. I think the\nissue is empathy—the capacity for empathy is lacking.”\nRedse later married, had two children, and then divorced. Every now and then Jobs\nwould openly pine for her, even after he was happily married. And when he began his\nbattle with cancer, she got in touch again to give support. She became very emotional\nwhenever  she  recalled  their  relationship.  “Though  our  values  clashed  and  made  it\nimpossible for us to have the relationship we once hoped for,” she told me, “the care\nand love I felt for him decades ago has continued.” Similarly, Jobs suddenly started to\ncry one afternoon as he sat in his living room reminiscing about her. “She was one of the\npurest people I’ve ever known,” he said, tears rolling down his cheeks. “There was\nsomething spiritual about her and spiritual about the connection we had.” He said he\nalways regretted that they could not make it work, and he knew that she had such regrets\nas well. But it was not meant to be. On that they both agreed.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\nFAMILY MAN\nAt Home with the Jobs Clan\nWith Laurene Powell, 1991\nLaurene Powell\nBy this point, based on his dating history, a matchmaker could have put together a\ncomposite sketch of the woman who would be right for Jobs. Smart, yet unpretentious.\nTough enough to stand up to him, yet Zen-like enough to rise above turmoil. Well-\neducated and independent, yet ready to make accommodations for him and a family.\nDown-to-earth, but with a touch of the ethereal. Savvy enough to know how to manage\nhim, but secure enough to not always need to. And it wouldn’t hurt to be a beautiful,\nlanky blonde with an easygoing sense of humor who liked organic vegetarian food. In\nOctober 1989, after his split with Tina Redse, just such a woman walked into his life.\n\nMore specifically, just such a woman walked into his classroom. Jobs had agreed to\ngive one of the “View from the Top” lectures at the Stanford Business School one\nThursday evening. Laurene Powell was a new graduate student at the business school,\nand a guy in her class talked her into going to the lecture. They arrived late and all the\nseats were taken, so they sat in the aisle. When an usher told them they had to move,\nPowell took her friend down to the front row and commandeered two of the reserved\nseats there. Jobs was led to the one next to her when he arrived. “I looked to my right,\nand there was a beautiful girl there, so we started chatting while I was waiting to be\nintroduced,” Jobs recalled. They bantered a bit, and Laurene joked that she was sitting\nthere because she had won a raffle, and the prize was that he got to take her to dinner.\n“He was so adorable,” she later said.\nAfter the speech Jobs hung around on the edge of the stage chatting with students. He\nwatched Powell leave, then come back and stand at the edge of the crowd, then leave\nagain. He bolted out after her, brushing past the dean, who was trying to grab him for a\nconversation. After catching up with her in the parking lot, he said, “Excuse me, wasn’t\nthere something about a raffle you won, that I’m supposed to take you to dinner?” She\nlaughed. “How about Saturday?” he asked. She agreed and wrote down her number.\nJobs headed to his car to drive up to the Thomas Fogarty winery in the Santa Cruz\nmountains above Woodside, where the NeXT education sales group was holding a\ndinner. But he suddenly stopped and turned around. “I thought, wow, I’d rather have\ndinner with her than the education group, so I ran back to her car and said ‘How about\ndinner tonight?’” She said yes. It was a beautiful fall evening, and they walked into\nPalo Alto to a funky vegetarian restaurant, St. Michael’s Alley, and ended up staying\nthere for four hours. “We’ve been together ever since,” he said.\nAvie Tevanian was sitting at the winery restaurant waiting with the rest of the NeXT\neducation group. “Steve was sometimes unreliable, but when I talked to him I realized\nthat  something  special  had  come  up,”  he  said.  As  soon  as  Powell  got  home,  after\nmidnight, she called her close friend Kathryn (Kat) Smith, who was at Berkeley, and left\na message on her machine. “You will not believe what just happened to me!” it said.\n“You will not believe who I met!” Smith called back the next morning and heard the\ntale. “We had known about Steve, and he was a person of interest to us, because we\nwere business students,” she recalled.\nPowell later said that she wasn’t focused on meeting Jobs and that the encounter had\nbeen pure serendipity. She went only because her friend wanted to go, and she was\nslightly confused as to who they were going to see. “I knew that Steve Jobs was the\nspeaker, but the face I thought of was that of Bill Gates,” she recalled. “I had them\nmixed up. This was 1989. He was working at NeXT, and he was not that big of a deal to\nme. I wasn’t that enthused, but my friend was, so we went.”\n“There were only two women in my life that I was truly in love with, Tina and\nLaurene,” Jobs later said. “I thought I was in love with Joan Baez, but I really just liked\nher a lot. It was just Tina and then Laurene.”\n\nLaurene Powell had been born in New Jersey in 1963 and learned to be self-sufficient\nat an early age. Her father was a Marine Corps pilot who died a hero in a crash in Santa\nAna, California; he had been leading a crippled plane in for a landing, and when it hit\nhis plane he kept flying in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid a residential area rather than\nejecting in time to save his life. Her mother’s second marriage turned out to be a\nhorrible situation, but she felt she couldn’t leave because she had no means to support\nher large family. For ten years Laurene and her three brothers had to suffer in a tense\nhousehold, keeping a good demeanor while compartmentalizing problems. She did well.\n“The lesson I learned was clear, that I always wanted to be self-sufficient,” she said. “I\ntook pride in that. My relationship with money is that it’s a tool to be self-sufficient, but\nit’s not something that is part of who I am.”\nAfter graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, she worked at Goldman Sachs\nas a fixed income trading strategist, dealing with enormous sums of money that she\ntraded for the house account. Jon Corzine, her boss, tried to get her to stay at Goldman,\nbut instead she decided the work was unedifying. “You could be really successful,” she\nsaid, “but you’re just contributing to capital formation.” So after three years she quit and\nwent  to  Florence,  Italy,  living  there  for  eight  months  before  enrolling  in  Stanford\nBusiness School.\nAfter their Thursday night dinner, she invited Jobs over to her Palo Alto apartment\non Saturday. Kat Smith drove down from Berkeley and pretended to be her roommate so\nshe could meet him as well. Their relationship became very passionate. “They would\nkiss and make out,” Smith said. “He was enraptured with her. He would call me on the\nphone and ask, ‘What do you think, does she like me?’ Here I am in this bizarre position\nof having this iconic person call me.”\nThat New Year’s Eve of 1989 the three went to Chez Panisse, the famed Alice\nWaters restaurant in Berkeley, along with Lisa, then eleven. Something happened at the\ndinner that caused Jobs and Powell to start arguing. They left separately, and Powell\nended up spending the night at Kat Smith’s apartment. At nine the next morning there\nwas a knock at the door, and Smith opened it to find Jobs, standing in the drizzle holding\nsome wildflowers he had picked. “May I come in and see Laurene?” he said. She was\nstill asleep, and he walked into the bedroom. A couple of hours went by, while Smith\nwaited in the living room, unable to go in and get her clothes. Finally, she put a coat on\nover her nightgown and went to Peet’s Coffee to pick up some food. Jobs did not\nemerge until after noon. “Kat, can you come here for a minute?” he asked. They all\ngathered in the bedroom. “As you know, Laurene’s father passed away, and Laurene’s\nmother isn’t here, and since you’re her best friend, I’m going to ask you the question,”\nhe said. “I’d like to marry Laurene. Will you give your blessing?”\nSmith clambered onto the bed and thought about it. “Is this okay with you?” she\nasked Powell. When she nodded yes, Smith announced, “Well, there’s your answer.”\nIt was not, however, a definitive answer. Jobs had a way of focusing on something\nwith insane intensity for a while and then, abruptly, turning away his gaze. At work, he\n\nwould focus on what he wanted to, when he wanted to, and on other matters he would\nbe unresponsive, no matter how hard people tried to get him to engage. In his personal\nlife, he was the same way. At times he and Powell would indulge in public displays of\naffection that were so intense they embarrassed everyone in their presence, including\nKat Smith and Powell’s mother. In the mornings at his Woodside mansion, he would\nwake Powell up by blasting the Fine Young Cannibals’ “She Drives Me Crazy” on his\ntape deck. Yet at other times he would ignore her. “Steve would fluctuate between\nintense focus, where she was the center of the universe, to being coldly distant and\nfocused on work,” said Smith. “He had the power to focus like a laser beam, and when\nit came across you, you basked in the light of his attention. When it moved to another\npoint of focus, it was very, very dark for you. It was very confusing to Laurene.”\nOnce she had accepted his marriage proposal on the first day of 1990, he didn’t\nmention it again for several months. Finally, Smith confronted him while they were\nsitting on the edge of a sandbox in Palo Alto. What was going on? Jobs replied that he\nneeded to feel sure that Powell could handle the life he lived and the type of person he\nwas. In September she became fed up with waiting and moved out.\nFor a while he sulked or ignored the situation. Then he thought he might still be in\nlove with Tina Redse; he sent her roses and tried to convince her to return to him,\nmaybe even get married. He was not sure what he wanted, and he surprised a wide\nswath of friends and even acquaintances by asking them what he should do. Who was\nprettier, he would ask, Tina or Laurene? Who did they like better? Who should he\nmarry? In a chapter about this in Mona Simpson’s novel A  Regular  Guy,  the  Jobs\ncharacter “asked more than a hundred people who they thought was more beautiful.” But\nthat was fiction; in reality, it was probably fewer than a hundred. After a month of\nindecision, he gave her a diamond ring in October 1990, and she moved back in.\nHe ended up making the right choice. As Redse told friends, she would never have\nsurvived if she had gone back to Jobs, nor would their marriage. Even though he would\npine about the spiritual nature of his connection to Redse, he had a far more solid\nrelationship with Powell. He liked her, he loved her, he respected her, and he was\ncomfortable with her. He may not have seen her as mystical, but she was a sensible\nanchor for his life. “He is the luckiest guy to have landed with Laurene, who is smart\nand can engage him intellectually and can sustain his ups and downs and tempestuous\npersonality,” said Joanna Hoffman. “Because she is not neurotic, Steve may feel that she\nis not as mystical as Tina or something. But that’s silly.” Andy Hertzfeld agreed.\n“Laurene looks a lot like Tina, but she is totally different because she is tougher and\narmor-plated. That’s why the marriage works.” Jobs understood this as well. Despite\nhis emotional turbulence and occasional meanness, the marriage would turn out to be\nenduring,  marked  by  loyalty  and  faithfulness,  overcoming  the  ups  and  downs  and\njangling emotional complexities it encountered.\nIn  December  Jobs  took  Powell to  his  favorite  vacation  spot,  Kona  Village  in\nHawaii. He had started going there nine years earlier when, stressed out at Apple, he\n\nhad asked his assistant to pick out a place for him to escape. At first glance, he didn’t\nlike the cluster of sparse thatched-roof bungalows nestled on a beach on the big island\nof Hawaii. It was a family resort, with communal eating. But within hours he had begun\nto view it as paradise. There was a simplicity and spare beauty that moved him, and he\nreturned whenever he could. He especially enjoyed being there that December with\nPowell. Their love had matured. The night before Christmas he again declared, even\nmore  formally,  that  he  wanted  to  marry  her.  Soon  another  factor  would  drive  that\ndecision. While in Hawaii, Powell got pregnant. “We know exactly where it happened,”\nJobs later said with a laugh.\nThe Wedding, March 18, 1991\nAvie Tevanian decided Jobs needed a bachelor’s party. This was not as easy as it\nsounded. Jobs did not like to party and didn’t have a gang of male buddies. He didn’t\neven have a best man. So the party turned out to be just Tevanian and Richard Crandall,\na  computer  science  professor  at  Reed  who  had  taken  a  leave  to  work  at  NeXT.\nTevanian hired a limo, and when they got to Jobs’s house, Powell answered the door\ndressed in a suit and wearing a fake moustache, saying that she wanted to come as one\nof the guys. It was just a joke, and soon the three bachelors, none of them drinkers, were\nrolling  to  San  Francisco  to  see  if  they  could  pull  off  their  own  pale  version  of  a\nbachelor party.\nTevanian had been unable to get reservations at Greens, the vegetarian restaurant at\nFort Mason that Jobs liked, so he booked a very fancy restaurant at a hotel. “I don’t\nwant to eat here,” Jobs announced as soon as the bread was placed on the table. He\nmade them get up and walk out, to the horror of Tevanian, who was not yet used to\nJobs’s restaurant manners. He led them to Café Jacqueline in North Beach, the soufflé\nplace that he loved, which was indeed a better choice. Afterward they took the limo\nacross the Golden Gate Bridge to a bar in Sausalito, where all three ordered shots of\ntequila but only sipped them. “It was not great as bachelor parties go, but it was the best\nwe could come up with for someone like Steve, and nobody else volunteered to do it,”\nrecalled  Tevanian.  Jobs  was  appreciative.  He  decided  that  he  wanted  Tevanian  to\nmarry his sister Mona Simpson. Though nothing came of it, the thought was a sign of\naffection.\nPowell had fair warning of what she was getting into. As she was planning the\nwedding, the person who was going to do the calligraphy for the invitations came by the\nhouse to show them some options. There was no furniture for her to sit on, so she sat on\nthe floor and laid out the samples. Jobs looked for a few minutes, then got up and left\nthe room. They waited for him to come back, but he didn’t. After a while Powell went\nto find him in his room. “Get rid of her,” he said. “I can’t look at her stuff. It’s shit.”\n\nOn March 18, 1991, Steven Paul Jobs, thirty-six, married Laurene Powell, twenty-\nseven,  at  the  Ahwahnee  Lodge  in  Yosemite  National  Park.  Built  in  the  1920s,  the\nAhwahnee is a sprawling pile of stone, concrete, and timber designed in a style that\nmixed Art Deco, the Arts and Crafts movement, and the Park Service’s love of huge\nfireplaces. Its best features are the views. It has floor-to-ceiling windows looking out\non Half Dome and Yosemite Falls.\nAbout  fifty  people  came,  including  Steve’s  father  Paul  Jobs  and  sister  Mona\nSimpson. She brought her fiancé, Richard Appel, a lawyer who went on to become a\ntelevision comedy writer. (As a writer for The Simpsons, he named Homer’s mother\nafter his wife.) Jobs insisted that they all arrive by chartered bus; he wanted to control\nall aspects of the event.\nThe ceremony was in the solarium, with the snow coming down hard and Glacier\nPoint just visible in the distance. It was conducted by Jobs’s longtime So ̄to ̄ Zen\nteacher, Kobun Chino, who shook a stick, struck a gong, lit incense, and chanted in a\nmumbling manner that most guests found incomprehensible. “I thought he was drunk,”\nsaid Tevanian. He wasn’t. The wedding cake was in the shape of Half Dome, the granite\ncrest at the end of Yosemite Valley, but since it was strictly vegan—devoid of eggs,\nmilk,  or  any  refined  products—more  than  a  few  of  the  guests  found  it  inedible.\nAfterward  they  all  went  hiking,  and  Powell’s  three  strapping  brothers  launched  a\nsnowball fight, with lots of tackling and roughhousing. “You see, Mona,” Jobs said to\nhis sister, “Laurene is descended from Joe Namath and we’re descended from John\nMuir.”\nA Family Home\nPowell shared her husband’s interest in natural foods. While at business school, she had\nworked part time at Odwalla, the juice company, where she helped develop the first\nmarketing plan. After marrying Jobs, she felt that it was important to have a career,\nhaving learned from her childhood the need to be self-sufficient. So she started her own\ncompany, Terravera, that made ready-to-eat organic meals and delivered them to stores\nthroughout northern California.\nInstead of living in the isolated and rather spooky unfurnished Woodside mansion,\nthe couple moved into a charming and unpretentious house on a corner in a family-\nfriendly neighborhood in old Palo Alto. It was a privileged realm—neighbors would\neventually include the visionary venture capitalist John Doerr, Google’s founder Larry\nPage, and Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg, along with Andy Hertzfeld and Joanna\nHoffman—but the homes were not ostentatious, and there were no high hedges or long\ndrives shielding them from view. Instead, houses were nestled on lots next to each other\n\nalong  flat,  quiet  streets  flanked  by  wide  sidewalks.  “We  wanted  to  live  in  a\nneighborhood where kids could walk to see friends,” Jobs later said.\nThe house was not the minimalist and modernist style Jobs would have designed if\nhe had built a home from scratch. Nor was it a large or distinctive mansion that would\nmake people stop and take notice as they drove down his street in Palo Alto. It was\nbuilt in the 1930s by a local designer named Carr Jones, who specialized in carefully\ncrafted homes in the “storybook style” of English or French country cottages.\nThe  two-story  house  was  made of  red  brick,  with  exposed  wood  beams  and  a\nshingle roof with curved lines; it evoked a rambling Cotswold cottage, or perhaps a\nhome where a well-to-do Hobbit might have lived. The one Californian touch was a\nmission-style courtyard framed by the wings of the house. The two-story vaulted-ceiling\nliving room was informal, with a floor of tile and terra-cotta. At one end was a large\ntriangular window leading up to the peak of the ceiling; it had stained glass when Jobs\nbought it, as if it were a chapel, but he replaced it with clear glass. The other renovation\nhe and Powell made was to expand the kitchen to include a wood-burning pizza oven\nand room for a long wooden table that would become the family’s primary gathering\nplace. It was supposed to be a four-month renovation, but it took sixteen months because\nJobs kept redoing the design. They also bought the small house behind them and razed it\nto make a backyard, which Powell turned into a beautiful natural garden filled with a\nprofusion of seasonal flowers along with vegetables and herbs.\nJobs became fascinated by the way Carr Jones relied on old material, including used\nbricks and wood from telephone poles, to provide a simple and sturdy structure. The\nbeams in the kitchen had been used to make the molds for the concrete foundations of the\nGolden Gate Bridge, which was under construction when the house was built. “He was\na  careful  craftsman  who  was  self-taught,”  Jobs  said  as  he  pointed  out  each  of  the\ndetails. “He cared more about being inventive than about making money, and he never\ngot rich. He never left California. His ideas came from reading books in the library and\nArchitectural Digest.”\nJobs had never furnished his Woodside house beyond a few bare essentials: a chest\nof drawers and a mattress in his bedroom, a card table and some folding chairs in what\nwould  have  been  a  dining  room.  He  wanted  around  him  only  things  that  he  could\nadmire, and that made it hard simply to go out and buy a lot of furniture. Now that he\nwas living in a normal neighborhood home with a wife and soon a child, he had to make\nsome concessions to necessity. But it was hard. They got beds, dressers, and a music\nsystem for the living room, but items like sofas took longer. “We spoke about furniture\nin theory for eight years,” recalled Powell. “We spent a lot of time asking ourselves,\n‘What is the purpose of a sofa?’” Buying appliances was also a philosophical task, not\njust an impulse purchase. A few years later, Jobs described to Wired the process that\nwent into getting a new washing machine:\n\nIt turns out that the Americans make washers and dryers all wrong. The Europeans make\nthem much better—but they take twice as long to do clothes! It turns out that they wash\nthem  with  about  a  quarter  as  much  water  and  your  clothes  end  up  with  a  lot  less\ndetergent on them. Most important, they don’t trash your clothes. They use a lot less\nsoap, a lot less water, but they come out much cleaner, much softer, and they last a lot\nlonger. We spent some time in our family talking about what’s the trade-off we want to\nmake. We ended up talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family.\nDid we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half? Or\ndid we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer? Did we care\nabout using a quarter of the water? We spent about two weeks talking about this every\nnight at the dinner table.\nThey ended up getting a Miele washer and dryer, made in Germany. “I got more thrill\nout of them than I have out of any piece of high tech in years,” Jobs said.\nThe one piece of art that Jobs bought for the vaulted-ceiling living room was an\nAnsel Adams print of the winter sunrise in the Sierra Nevada taken from Lone Pine,\nCalifornia. Adams had made the huge mural print for his daughter, who later sold it. At\none point Jobs’s housekeeper wiped it with a wet cloth, and Jobs tracked down a\nperson who had worked with Adams to come to the house, strip it down a layer, and\nrestore it.\nThe house was so unassuming that Bill Gates was somewhat baffled when he visited\nwith his wife. “Do all of you live here?” asked Gates, who was then in the process of\nbuilding  a  66,000-square-foot  mansion  near  Seattle.  Even  when  he  had  his  second\ncoming at Apple and was a world-famous billionaire, Jobs had no security guards or\nlive-in servants, and he even kept the back door unlocked during the day.\nHis only security problem came, sadly and strangely, from Burrell Smith, the mop-\nheaded, cherubic Macintosh hardware engineer who had been Andy Hertzfeld’s close\nfriend. After leaving Apple, Smith descended into schizophrenia. He lived in a house\ndown the street from Hertzfeld, and as his disorder progressed he began wandering the\nstreets naked, at other times smashing the windows of cars and churches. He was put on\nstrong medication, but it proved difficult to calibrate. At one point when his demons\nreturned, he began going over to the Jobs house in the evenings, throwing rocks through\nthe windows, leaving rambling letters, and once tossing a firecracker into the house. He\nwas arrested, but the case was dropped when he went for more treatment. “Burrell was\nso funny and naïve, and then one April day he suddenly snapped,” Jobs recalled. “It was\nthe weirdest, saddest thing.”\nJobs was sympathetic, and often asked Hertzfeld what more he could do to help. At\none point Smith was thrown in jail and refused to identify himself. When Hertzfeld\nfound  out,  three  days  later,  he  called  Jobs  and  asked  for  assistance  in  getting  him\n\nreleased.  Jobs  did  help,  but  he  surprised  Hertzfeld  with  a  question:  “If  something\nsimilar happened to me, would you take as good care of me as you do Burrell?”\nJobs kept his mansion in Woodside, about ten miles up into the mountains from Palo\nAlto. He wanted to tear down the fourteen-bedroom 1925 Spanish colonial revival, and\nhe  had  plans  drawn  up  to  replace  it  with  an  extremely  simple,  Japanese-inspired\nmodernist home one-third the size. But for more than twenty years he engaged in a slow-\nmoving series of court battles with preservationists who wanted the crumbling original\nhouse to be saved. (In 2011 he finally got permission to raze the house, but by then he\nhad no desire to build a second home.)\nOn occasion Jobs would use the semi-abandoned Woodside home, especially its\nswimming pool, for family parties. When Bill Clinton was president, he and Hillary\nClinton stayed in the 1950s ranch house on the property on their visits to their daughter,\nwho was at Stanford. Since both the main house and ranch house were unfurnished,\nPowell would call furniture and art dealers when the Clintons were coming and pay\nthem to furnish the houses temporarily. Once, shortly after the Monica Lewinsky flurry\nbroke, Powell was making a final inspection of the furnishings and noticed that one of\nthe paintings was missing. Worried, she asked the advance team and Secret Service\nwhat had happened. One of them pulled her aside and explained that it was a painting of\na dress on a hanger, and given the issue of the blue dress in the Lewinsky matter they\nhad decided to hide it. (During one of his late-night phone conversations with Jobs,\nClinton asked how he should handle the Lewinsky issue. “I don’t know if you did it, but\nif so, you’ve got to tell the country,” Jobs told the president. There was silence on the\nother end of the line.)\nLisa Moves In\nIn the middle of Lisa’s eighth-grade year, her teachers called Jobs. There were serious\nproblems, and it was probably best for her to move out of her mother’s house. So Jobs\nwent on a walk with Lisa, asked about the situation, and offered to let her move in with\nhim. She was a mature girl, just turning fourteen, and she thought about it for two days.\nThen she said yes. She already knew which room she wanted: the one right next to her\nfather’s. When she was there once, with no one home, she had tested it out by lying\ndown on the bare floor.\nIt was a tough period. Chrisann Brennan would sometimes walk over from her own\nhouse a few blocks away and yell at them from the yard. When I asked her recently\nabout her behavior and the allegations that led to Lisa’s moving out of her house, she\nsaid that she had still not been able to process in her own mind what occurred during\nthat period. But then she wrote me a long email that she said would help explain the\nsituation:\n\nDo you know how Steve was able to get the city of Woodside to allow him to tear his\nWoodside home down? There was a community of people who wanted to preserve his\nWoodside house due to its historical value, but Steve wanted to tear it down and build a\nhome with an orchard. Steve let that house fall into so much disrepair and decay over a\nnumber of years that there was no way to save it. The strategy he used to get what he\nwanted was to simply follow the line of least involvement and resistance. So by his\ndoing nothing on the house, and maybe even leaving the windows open for years, the\nhouse fell apart. Brilliant, no? ... In a similar way did Steve work to undermine my\neffectiveness AND my well being at the time when Lisa was 13 and 14 to get her to\nmove into his house. He started with one strategy but then it moved to another easier one\nthat was even more destructive to me and more problematic for Lisa. It may not have\nbeen of the greatest integrity, but he got what he wanted.\nLisa lived with Jobs and Powell for all four of her years at Palo Alto High School, and\nshe began using the name Lisa Brennan-Jobs. He tried to be a good father, but there\nwere times when he was cold and distant. When Lisa felt she had to escape, she would\nseek refuge with a friendly family who lived nearby. Powell tried to be supportive, and\nshe was the one who attended most of Lisa’s school events.\nBy the time Lisa was a senior, she seemed to be flourishing. She joined the school\nnewspaper, The Campanile, and became the coeditor. Together with her classmate Ben\nHewlett, grandson of the man who gave her father his first job, she exposed secret\nraises that the school board had given to administrators. When it came time to go to\ncollege, she knew she wanted to go east. She applied to Harvard—forging her father’s\nsignature on the application because he was out of town—and was accepted for the\nclass entering in 1996.\nAt  Harvard  Lisa  worked  on  the  college  newspaper, The  Crimson,  and  then  the\nliterary magazine, The Advocate. After breaking up with her boyfriend, she took a year\nabroad at King’s College, London. Her relationship with her father remained tumultuous\nthroughout her college years. When she would come home, fights over small things—\nwhat was being served for dinner, whether she was paying enough attention to her half-\nsiblings—would  blow  up,  and  they  would  not  speak  to  each  other  for  weeks  and\nsometimes  months.  The  arguments  occasionally  got  so  bad  that  Jobs  would  stop\nsupporting her. One year she borrowed money for her Harvard tuition from a married\ncouple, both lawyers, who lived down the street in Palo Alto and whose house she\nstayed at sometimes. Later, Andy Hertzfeld lent Lisa $20,000 when she thought that her\nfather was not going to pay her tuition at a graduate writing program at Bennington\nCollege. “He was mad at me for making the loan,” Hertzfeld recalled, “but he called\nearly the next morning and had his accountant wire me the money.”\nThere were, however, some nice times during those years, including one summer\nwhen  Lisa  came  back  home  and  performed  at  a  benefit  concert  for  the  Electronic\n\nFrontier Foundation, an advocacy group that supports access to technology. The concert\ntook place at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, which had been made famous\nby the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. She sang Tracy Chapman’s\nanthem “Talkin’ bout a Revolution” (“Poor people are gonna rise up / And get their\nshare”) as her father stood in the back cradling his one-year-old daughter, Erin.\nJobs’s  ups  and  downs with  Lisa  continued  after  she  moved  to  Manhattan  as  a\nfreelance writer. Their problems were exacerbated because of Jobs’s frustrations with\nChrisann. He had bought a $700,000 house for Chrisann to use and put it in Lisa’s name,\nbut Lisa signed it over to Chrisann who then sold it, using the money to travel with a\nspiritual advisor and to live in Paris. Once the money ran out, she returned to San\nFrancisco and became an artist creating “light paintings” and Buddhist mandalas. “I am\na ‘Connector’ and a visionary contributor to the future of evolving humanity and the\nascended Earth,” she said on her website (which Hertzfeld maintained for her). “I\nexperience the forms, color, and sound frequencies of sacred vibration as I create and\nlive with the paintings.” When Chrisann needed money for a bad sinus infection and\ndental problem, Jobs refused to give it to her, causing Lisa again to not speak to him for\na few years. And thus the pattern would continue.\nMona Simpson used all of this, plus her imagination, as a springboard for her third\nnovel, A Regular Guy, published in 1996. The book’s title character is based on Jobs,\nand  to  some  extent  it  adheres  to  reality:  It  depicts  Jobs’s  quiet  generosity  to,  and\npurchase of a special car for, a brilliant friend who had degenerative bone disease, and\nit accurately describes many unflattering aspects of his relationship with Lisa, including\nhis original denial of paternity. But other parts are purely fiction; Chrisann had taught\nLisa at a very early age how to drive, for example, but the book’s scene of “Jane”\ndriving a truck across the mountains alone at age five to find her father of course never\nhappened. In addition, there are little details in the novel that, in journalist parlance, are\ntoo good to check, such as the head-snapping description of the character based on Jobs\nin the very first sentence: “He was a man too busy to flush toilets.”\nOn  the  surface,  the  novel’s  fictional  portrayal  of  Jobs  seems  harsh.  Simpson\ndescribes her main character as unable “to see any need to pander to the wishes or\nwhims of other people.” His hygiene is also as dubious as that of the real Jobs. “He\ndidn’t  believe  in  deodorant  and  often  professed  that  with  a  proper  diet  and  the\npeppermint castile soap, you would neither perspire nor smell.” But the novel is lyrical\nand intricate on many levels, and by the end there is a fuller picture of a man who loses\ncontrol of the great company he had founded and learns to appreciate the daughter he\nhad abandoned. The final scene is of him dancing with his daughter.\nJobs later said that he never read the novel. “I heard it was about me,” he told me,\n“and if it was about me, I would have gotten really pissed off, and I didn’t want to get\npissed at my sister, so I didn’t read it.” However, he told the New York Times a few\n\nmonths after the book appeared that he had read it and saw the reflections of himself in\nthe main character. “About 25% of it is totally me, right down to the mannerisms,” he\ntold the reporter, Steve Lohr. “And I’m certainly not telling you which 25%.” His wife\nsaid that, in fact, Jobs glanced at the book and asked her to read it for him to see what\nhe should make of it.\nSimpson sent the manuscript to Lisa before it was published, but at first she didn’t\nread more than the opening. “In the first few pages, I was confronted with my family, my\nanecdotes,  my  things,  my  thoughts,  myself  in  the  character  Jane,”  she  noted.  “And\nsandwiched between the truths was invention—lies to me, made more evident because\nof their dangerous proximity to the truth.” Lisa was wounded, and she wrote a piece for\nthe Harvard Advocate explaining why. Her first draft was very bitter, then she toned it\ndown a bit before she published it. She felt violated by Simpson’s friendship. “I didn’t\nknow, for those six years, that Mona was collecting,” she wrote. “I didn’t know that as I\nsought her consolations and took her advice, she, too, was taking.” Eventually Lisa\nreconciled with Simpson. They went out to a coffee shop to discuss the book, and Lisa\ntold her that she hadn’t been able to finish it. Simpson told her she would like the\nending. Over the years Lisa had an on-and-off relationship with Simpson, but it would\nbe closer in some ways than the one she had with her father.\nChildren\nWhen Powell gave birth in 1991, a few months after her wedding to Jobs, their child\nwas known for two weeks as “baby boy Jobs,” because settling on a name was proving\nonly slightly less difficult than choosing a washing machine. Finally, they named him\nReed Paul Jobs. His middle name was that of Jobs’s father, and his first name (both\nJobs and Powell insist) was chosen because it sounded good rather than because it was\nthe name of Jobs’s college.\nReed turned out to be like his father in many ways: incisive and smart, with intense\neyes and a mesmerizing charm. But unlike his father, he had sweet manners and a self-\neffacing grace. He was creative—as a kid he liked to dress in costume and stay in\ncharacter—and  also  a  great  student,  interested  in  science.  He  could  replicate  his\nfather’s stare, but he was demonstrably affectionate and seemed not to have an ounce of\ncruelty in his nature.\nErin Siena Jobs was born in 1995. She was a little quieter and developed into a\nmore introspective child with an emotional intelligence that gave her an acute sense of\nother people’s feelings. She picked up her father’s interest in design and architecture,\nbut she also learned to keep a bit of an emotional distance, so as not to be hurt by his\ndetachment.\n\nThe youngest child, Eve, was born in 1998, and she turned into a strong-willed,\nfunny firecracker who, neither needy nor intimidated, knew how to handle her father,\nnegotiate with him (and sometimes win), and even make fun of him. Her father joked\nthat she’s the one who will run Apple someday, if she doesn’t become president of the\nUnited States.\nIn 1995 Oracle’s CEO Larry Ellison threw a fortieth-birthday party for Jobs filled\nwith tech stars and moguls. Ellison had become a close friend, and he would often take\nthe Jobs family out on one of his many luxurious yachts. Reed started referring to him as\n“our  rich  friend,”  which  was  amusing  evidence  of  how  his  father  refrained  from\nostentatious displays of wealth. The lesson Jobs learned from his Buddhist days was\nthat material possessions often cluttered life rather than enriched it. “Every other CEO I\nknow has a security detail,” he said. “They’ve even got them at their homes. It’s a nutso\nway to live. We just decided that’s not how we wanted to raise our kids.”\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nTOY STORY\nBuzz and Woody to the Rescue\nJeffrey Katzenberg\n“It’s kind of fun to do the impossible,” Walt Disney once said. That was the type of\nattitude that appealed to Jobs. He admired Disney’s obsession with detail and design,\nand he felt that there was a natural fit between Pixar and the movie studio that Disney\nhad founded.\nThe Walt Disney Company had licensed Pixar’s Computer Animation Production\nSystem, and that made it the largest customer for Pixar’s computers. One day Jeffrey\nKatzenberg,  the  head  of  Disney’s  film  division,  invited  Jobs  down  to  the  Burbank\nstudios to see the technology in operation. As the Disney folks were showing him\naround, Jobs turned to Katzenberg and asked, “Is Disney happy with Pixar?” With great\nexuberance, Katzenberg answered yes. Then Jobs asked, “Do you think we at Pixar are\nhappy with Disney?” Katzenberg said he assumed so. “No, we’re not,” Jobs said. “We\nwant to do a film with you. That would make us happy.”\nKatzenberg was willing. He admired John Lasseter’s animated shorts and had tried\nunsuccessfully to lure him back to Disney. So Katzenberg invited the Pixar team down\nto discuss partnering on a film. When Catmull, Jobs, and Lasseter got settled at the\nconference table, Katzenberg was forthright. “John, since you won’t come work for\nme,” he said, looking at Lasseter, “I’m going to make it work this way.”\nJust as the Disney company shared some traits with Pixar, so Katzenberg shared\nsome  with  Jobs.  Both  were  charming  when  they  wanted  to  be,  and  aggressive  (or\nworse) when it suited their moods or interests. Alvy Ray Smith, on the verge of quitting\nPixar, was at the meeting. “Katzenberg and Jobs impressed me as a lot alike,” he\nrecalled. “Tyrants with an amazing gift of gab.” Katzenberg was delightfully aware of\n\nthis. “Everybody thinks I’m a tyrant,” he told the Pixar team. “I am a tyrant. But I’m\nusually right.” One can imagine Jobs saying the same.\nAs befitted two men of equal passion, the negotiations between Katzenberg and Jobs\ntook months. Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar’s proprietary\ntechnology  for  making  3-D  animation.  Jobs  refused,  and  he  ended  up  winning  that\nengagement. Jobs had his own demand: Pixar would have part ownership of the film\nand its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels. “If that’s what you\nwant,” Katzenberg said, “we can just quit talking and you can leave now.” Jobs stayed,\nconceding that point.\nLasseter was riveted as he watched the two wiry and tightly wound principals parry\nand thrust. “Just to see Steve and Jeffrey go at it, I was in awe,” he recalled. “It was\nlike a fencing match. They were both masters.” But Katzenberg went into the match with\na saber, Jobs with a mere foil. Pixar was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal\nwith Disney far more than Disney needed a deal with Pixar. Plus, Disney could afford to\nfinance the whole enterprise, and Pixar couldn’t. The result was a deal, struck in May\n1991, by which Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative\ncontrol, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues. It had the option (but not the\nobligation) to do Pixar’s next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar)\nsequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with\nonly a small penalty.\nThe idea that John Lasseter pitched was called “Toy Story.” It sprang from a belief,\nwhich he and Jobs shared, that products have an essence to them, a purpose for which\nthey were made. If the object were to have feelings, these would be based on its desire\nto fulfill its essence. The purpose of a glass, for example, is to hold water; if it had\nfeelings, it would be happy when full and sad when empty. The essence of a computer\nscreen is to interface with a human. The essence of a unicycle is to be ridden in a\ncircus. As for toys, their purpose is to be played with by kids, and thus their existential\nfear is of being discarded or upstaged by newer toys. So a buddy movie pairing an old\nfavorite toy with a shiny new one would have an essential drama to it, especially when\nthe  action  revolved  around  the  toys’  being  separated  from  their  kid.  The  original\ntreatment began, “Everyone has had the traumatic childhood experience of losing a toy.\nOur story takes the toy’s point of view as he loses and tries to regain the single thing\nmost  important  to  him:  to  be  played  with  by  children.  This  is  the  reason  for  the\nexistence of all toys. It is the emotional foundation of their existence.”\nThe two main characters went through many iterations before they ended up as Buzz\nLightyear and Woody. Every couple of weeks, Lasseter and his team would put together\ntheir latest set of storyboards or footage to show the folks at Disney. In early screen\ntests, Pixar showed off its amazing technology by, for example, producing a scene of\nWoody rustling around on top of a dresser while the light rippling in through a Venetian\nblind  cast  shadows  on  his  plaid  shirt—an  effect  that  would  have  been  almost\nimpossible to render by hand. Impressing Disney with the plot, however, was more\n\ndifficult. At each presentation by Pixar, Katzenberg would tear much of it up, barking\nout his detailed comments and notes. And a cadre of clipboard-carrying flunkies was on\nhand to make sure every suggestion and whim uttered by Katzenberg received follow-up\ntreatment.\nKatzenberg’s big push was to add more edginess to the two main characters. It may\nbe an animated movie called Toy Story, he said, but it should not be aimed only at\nchildren. “At first there was no drama, no real story, and no conflict,” Katzenberg\nrecalled. He suggested that Lasseter watch some classic buddy movies, such as The\nDefiant Ones and 48 Hours, in which two characters with different attitudes are thrown\ntogether and have to bond. In addition, he kept pushing for what he called “edge,” and\nthat meant making Woody’s character more jealous, mean, and belligerent toward Buzz,\nthe new interloper in the toy box. “It’s a toy-eat-toy world,” Woody says at one point,\nafter pushing Buzz out of a window.\nAfter many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney execs, Woody had\nbeen stripped of almost all charm. In one scene he throws the other toys off the bed and\norders Slinky to come help. When Slinky hesitates, Woody barks, “Who said your job\nwas to think, spring-wiener?” Slinky then asks a question that the Pixar team members\nwould soon be asking themselves: “Why is the cowboy so scary?” As Tom Hanks, who\nhad signed up to be Woody’s voice, exclaimed at one point, “This guy’s a real jerk!”\nCut!\nLasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen by November\n1993, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney\nexecutives. Peter Schneider, the head of feature animation, had never been enamored of\nKatzenberg’s idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney, and he declared it a\nmess  and  ordered  that  production  be  stopped.  Katzenberg  agreed.  “Why  is  this  so\nterrible?”  he  asked  a  colleague,  Tom  Schumacher.  “Because  it’s  not  their  movie\nanymore,”  Schumacher  bluntly  replied.  He  later  explained,  “They  were  following\nKatzenberg’s notes, and the project had been driven completely off-track.”\nLasseter realized that Schumacher was right. “I sat there and I was pretty much\nembarrassed with what was on the screen,” he recalled. “It was a story filled with the\nmost unhappy, mean characters that I’ve ever seen.” He asked Disney for the chance to\nretreat back to Pixar and rework the script. Katzenberg was supportive.\nJobs did not insert himself much into the creative process. Given his proclivity to be\nin control, especially on matters of taste and design, this self-restraint was a testament\nto his respect for Lasseter and the other artists at Pixar—as well as for the ability of\nLasseter and Catmull to keep him at bay. He did, however, help manage the relationship\nwith  Disney,  and  the  Pixar  team  appreciated  that.  When  Katzenberg  and  Schneider\n\nhalted  production  on Toy  Story,  Jobs  kept  the  work  going  with  his  own  personal\nfunding. And he took their side against Katzenberg. “He had Toy Story all messed up,”\nJobs later said. “He wanted Woody to be a bad guy, and when he shut us down we kind\nof kicked him out and said, ‘This isn’t what we want,’ and did it the way we always\nwanted.”\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later. The character of\nWoody morphed from being a tyrannical boss of Andy’s other toys to being their wise\nleader.  His  jealousy  after  the  arrival  of  Buzz  Lightyear  was  portrayed  more\nsympathetically,  and  it  was  set  to  the  strains  of  a  Randy  Newman  song,  “Strange\nThings.” The scene in which Woody pushed Buzz out of the window was rewritten to\nmake Buzz’s fall the result of an accident triggered by a little trick Woody initiated\ninvolving a Luxo lamp. Katzenberg & Co. approved the new approach, and by February\n1994 the film was back in production.\nKatzenberg had been impressed with Jobs’s focus on keeping costs under control.\n“Even in the early budgeting process, Steve was very eager to do it as efficiently as\npossible,” he said. But the $17 million production budget was proving inadequate,\nespecially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed\nthem to make Woody too edgy. So Jobs demanded more in order to complete the film\nright. “Listen, we made a deal,” Katzenberg told him. “We gave you business control,\nand you agreed to do it for the amount we offered.” Jobs was furious. He would call\nKatzenberg by phone or fly down to visit him and be, in Katzenberg’s words, “as wildly\nrelentless as only Steve can be.” Jobs insisted that Disney was liable for the cost\noverruns because Katzenberg had so badly mangled the original concept that it required\nextra work to restore things. “Wait a minute!” Katzenberg shot back. “We were helping\nyou. You got the benefit of our creative help, and now you want us to pay you for that.”\nIt was a case of two control freaks arguing about who was doing the other a favor.\nEd  Catmull,  more  diplomatic  than  Jobs,  was  able  to  reach  a  compromise  new\nbudget. “I had a much more positive view of Jeffrey than some of the folks working on\nthe film did,” he said. But the incident did prompt Jobs to start plotting about how to\nhave more leverage with Disney in the future. He did not like being a mere contractor;\nhe liked being in control. That meant Pixar would have to bring its own funding to\nprojects in the future, and it would need a new deal with Disney.\nAs the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it. He had been talking\nto various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar, but\nwatching Woody and Buzz come to life made him realize that he might be on the verge\nof transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched\nthem repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. “I can’t tell\nyou the number of versions of Toy Story I saw before it came out,” said Larry Ellison.\n“It  eventually  became  a  form  of  torture.  I’d  go  over  there  and  see  the  latest  10%\nimprovement. Steve is obsessed with getting it right—both the story and the technology\n—and isn’t satisfied with anything less than perfection.”\n\nJobs’s sense that his investments in Pixar might actually pay off was reinforced when\nDisney  invited  him  to  attend  a  gala  press  preview  of  scenes  from Pocahontas  in\nJanuary 1995 in a tent in Manhattan’s Central Park. At the event, Disney CEO Michael\nEisner announced that Pocahontas would have its premiere in front of 100,000 people\non eighty-foot-high screens on the Great Lawn of Central Park. Jobs was a master\nshowman who knew how to stage great premieres, but even he was astounded by this\nplan. Buzz Lightyear’s great exhortation—“To infinity and beyond!”—suddenly seemed\nworth heeding.\nJobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to\ntake Pixar public. Even the usually eager investment bankers were dubious and said it\ncouldn’t  happen.  Pixar  had  spent  five  years  hemorrhaging  money.  But  Jobs  was\ndetermined. “I was nervous and argued that we should wait until after our second\nmovie,” Lasseter recalled. “Steve overruled me and said we needed the cash so we\ncould put up half the money for our films and renegotiate the Disney deal.”\nTo Infinity!\nThere were two premieres of Toy Story in November 1995. Disney organized one at El\nCapitan, a grand old theater in Los Angeles, and built a fun house next door featuring the\ncharacters. Pixar was given a handful of passes, but the evening and its celebrity guest\nlist was very much a Disney production; Jobs did not even attend. Instead, the next night\nhe rented the Regency, a similar theater in San Francisco, and held his own premiere.\nInstead of Tom Hanks and Steve Martin, the guests were Silicon Valley celebrities, such\nas Larry Ellison and Andy Grove. This was clearly Jobs’s show; he, not Lasseter, took\nthe stage to introduce the movie.\nThe dueling premieres highlighted a festering issue: Was Toy Story a Disney or a\nPixar movie? Was Pixar merely an animation contractor helping Disney make movies?\nOr was Disney merely a distributor and marketer helping Pixar roll out its movies? The\nanswer was somewhere in between. The question would be whether the egos involved,\nmainly those of Michael Eisner and Steve Jobs, could get to such a partnership.\nThe  stakes  were  raised  when Toy  Story  opened  to  blockbuster  commercial  and\ncritical success. It recouped its cost the first weekend, with a domestic opening of $30\nmillion, and it went on to become the top-grossing film of the year, beating Batman\nForever and Apollo 13, with $192 million in receipts domestically and a total of $362\nmillion worldwide. According to the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of the\nseventy-three critics surveyed gave it a positive review. Time’s Richard Corliss called\nit “the year’s most inventive comedy,” David Ansen of Newsweek pronounced it a\n“marvel,” and Janet Maslin of the New York Times recommended it both for children\nand adults as “a work of incredible cleverness in the best two-tiered Disney tradition.”\n\nThe only rub for Jobs was that reviewers such as Maslin wrote of the “Disney\ntradition,” not the emergence of Pixar. After reading her review, he decided he had to go\non the offensive to raise Pixar’s profile. When he and Lasseter went on the Charlie\nRose show, Jobs emphasized that Toy Story was a Pixar movie, and he even tried to\nhighlight  the  historic  nature  of  a  new  studio  being  born.  “Since Snow  White  was\nreleased, every major studio has tried to break into the animation business, and until\nnow Disney was the only studio that had ever made a feature animated film that was a\nblockbuster,” he told Rose. “Pixar has now become the second studio to do that.”\nJobs made a point of casting Disney as merely the distributor of a Pixar film. “He\nkept saying, ‘We at Pixar are the real thing and you Disney guys are shit,’” recalled\nMichael Eisner. “But we were the ones who made Toy Story work. We helped shape the\nmovie, and we pulled together all of our divisions, from our consumer marketers to the\nDisney Channel, to make it a hit.” Jobs came to the conclusion that the fundamental issue\n—Whose movie was it?—would have to be settled contractually rather than by a war of\nwords. “After Toy Story’s success,” he said, “I realized that we needed to cut a new\ndeal with Disney if we were ever to build a studio and not just be a work-for-hire\nplace.” But in order to sit down with Disney on an equal basis, Pixar had to bring\nmoney to the table. That required a successful IPO.\nThe public offering occurred exactly one week after Toy Story’s opening. Jobs had\ngambled that the movie would be successful, and the risky bet paid off, big-time. As\nwith the Apple IPO, a celebration was planned at the San Francisco office of the lead\nunderwriter at 7 a.m., when the shares were to go on sale. The plan had originally been\nfor the first shares to be offered at about $14, to be sure they would sell. Jobs insisted\non pricing them at $22, which would give the company more money if the offering was a\nsuccess. It was, beyond even his wildest hopes. It exceeded Netscape as the biggest IPO\nof the year. In the first half hour, the stock shot up to $45, and trading had to be delayed\nbecause there were too many buy orders. It then went up even further, to $49, before\nsettling back to close the day at $39.\nEarlier that year Jobs had been hoping to find a buyer for Pixar that would let him\nmerely recoup the $50 million he had put in. By the end of the day the shares he had\nretained—80%  of  the  company—were  worth  more  than  twenty  times  that,  an\nastonishing $1.2 billion. That was about five times what he’d made when Apple went\npublic in 1980. But Jobs told John Markoff of the New York Times that the money did\nnot mean much to him. “There’s no yacht in my future,” he said. “I’ve never done this\nfor the money.”\nThe  successful  IPO  meant  that  Pixar  would  no  longer  have  to  be  dependent  on\nDisney to finance its movies. That was just the leverage Jobs wanted. “Because we\ncould  now  fund  half  the  cost  of  our  movies,  I  could  demand  half  the  profits,”  he\n\nrecalled. “But more important, I wanted co-branding. These were to be Pixar as well as\nDisney movies.”\nJobs flew down to have lunch with Eisner, who was stunned at his audacity. They\nhad a three-picture deal, and Pixar had made only one. Each side had its own nuclear\nweapons.  After  an  acrimonious  split  with  Eisner,  Katzenberg  had  left  Disney  and\nbecome a cofounder, with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, of DreamWorks SKG. If\nEisner didn’t agree to a new deal with Pixar, Jobs said, then Pixar would go to another\nstudio, such as Katzenberg’s, once the three-picture deal was done. In Eisner’s hand\nwas the threat that Disney could, if that happened, make its own sequels to Toy Story,\nusing Woody and Buzz and all of the characters that Lasseter had created. “That would\nhave been like molesting our children,” Jobs later recalled. “John started crying when\nhe considered that possibility.”\nSo they hammered out a new arrangement. Eisner agreed to let Pixar put up half the\nmoney for future films and in return take half of the profits. “He didn’t think we could\nhave  many  hits,  so  he  thought  he  was  saving  himself  some  money,”  said  Jobs.\n“Ultimately that was great for us, because Pixar would have ten blockbusters in a row.”\nThey also agreed on co-branding, though that took a lot of haggling to define. “I took the\nposition that it’s a Disney movie, but eventually I relented,” Eisner recalled. “We start\nnegotiating how big the letters in ‘Disney’ are going to be, how big is ‘Pixar’ going to\nbe, just like four-year-olds.” But by the beginning of 1997 they had a deal, for five films\nover the course of ten years, and even parted as friends, at least for the time being.\n“Eisner was reasonable and fair to me then,” Jobs later said. “But eventually, over the\ncourse of a decade, I came to the conclusion that he was a dark man.”\nIn a letter to Pixar shareholders, Jobs explained that winning the right to have equal\nbranding with Disney on all the movies, as well as advertising and toys, was the most\nimportant aspect of the deal. “We want Pixar to grow into a brand that embodies the\nsame level of trust as the Disney brand,” he wrote. “But in order for Pixar to earn this\ntrust, consumers must know that Pixar is creating the films.” Jobs was known during his\ncareer for creating great products. But just as significant was his ability to create great\ncompanies with valuable brands. And he created two of the best of his era: Apple and\nPixar.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nTHE SECOND COMING\nWhat Rough Beast, Its Hour Come Round at Last ...\nSteve Jobs, 1996\nThings Fall Apart\nWhen Jobs unveiled the NeXT computer in 1988, there was a burst of excitement. That\nfizzled when the computer finally went on sale the following year. Jobs’s ability to\ndazzle, intimidate, and spin the press began to fail him, and there was a series of stories\non the company’s woes. “NeXT is incompatible with other computers at a time when\nthe industry is moving toward interchangeable systems,” Bart Ziegler of Associated\nPress reported. “Because relatively little software exists to run on NeXT, it has a hard\ntime attracting customers.”\nNeXT  tried  to  reposition  itself  as  the  leader  in  a  new  category,  personal\nworkstations, for people who wanted the power of a workstation and the friendliness of\na personal computer. But those customers were by now buying them from fast-growing\nSun Microsystems. Revenues for NeXT in 1990 were $28 million; Sun made $2.5\n\nbillion that year. IBM abandoned its deal to license the NeXT software, so Jobs was\nforced to do something against his nature: Despite his ingrained belief that hardware\nand software should be integrally linked, he agreed in January 1992 to license the\nNeXTSTEP operating system to run on other computers.\nOne surprising defender of Jobs was Jean-Louis Gassée, who had bumped elbows\nwith Jobs when he replaced him at Apple and subsequently been ousted himself. He\nwrote an article extolling the creativity of NeXT products. “NeXT might not be Apple,”\nGassée argued, “but Steve is still Steve.” A few days later his wife answered a knock\non the door and went running upstairs to tell him that Jobs was standing there. He\nthanked Gassée for the article and invited him to an event where Intel’s Andy Grove\nwould  join  Jobs  in  announcing  that  NeXTSTEP  would  be  ported  to  the  IBM/Intel\nplatform. “I sat next to Steve’s father, Paul Jobs, a movingly dignified individual,”\nGassée recalled. “He raised a difficult son, but he was proud and happy to see him\nonstage with Andy Grove.”\nA  year  later  Jobs  took  the  inevitable  subsequent  step:  He  gave  up  making  the\nhardware altogether. This was a painful decision, just as it had been when he gave up\nmaking hardware at Pixar. He cared about all aspects of his products, but the hardware\nwas  a  particular  passion.  He  was  energized  by  great  design,  obsessed  over\nmanufacturing details, and would spend hours watching his robots make his perfect\nmachines. But now he had to lay off more than half his workforce, sell his beloved\nfactory to Canon (which auctioned off the fancy furniture), and satisfy himself with a\ncompany  that  tried  to  license  an  operating  system  to  manufacturers  of  uninspired\nmachines.\nBy  the  mid-1990s  Jobs  was  finding  some  pleasure  in  his  new  family  life  and  his\nastonishing triumph in the movie business, but he despaired about the personal computer\nindustry. “Innovation has virtually ceased,” he told Gary Wolf of Wired at the end of\n1995. “Microsoft dominates with very little innovation. Apple lost. The desktop market\nhas entered the dark ages.”\nHe was also gloomy in an interview with Tony Perkins and the editors of Red\nHerring. First, he displayed the “Bad Steve” side of his personality. Soon after Perkins\nand his colleagues arrived, Jobs slipped out the back door “for a walk,” and he didn’t\nreturn for forty-five minutes. When the magazine’s photographer began taking pictures,\nhe snapped at her sarcastically and made her stop. Perkins later noted, “Manipulation,\nselfishness, or downright rudeness, we couldn’t figure out the motivation behind his\nmadness.” When he finally settled down for the interview, he said that even the advent\nof the web would do little to stop Microsoft’s domination. “Windows has won,” he\nsaid. “It beat the Mac, unfortunately, it beat UNIX, it beat OS/2. An inferior product\nwon.”\n\nApple Falling\nFor a few years after Jobs was ousted, Apple was able to coast comfortably with a high\nprofit margin based on its temporary dominance in desktop publishing. Feeling like a\ngenius back in 1987, John Sculley had made a series of proclamations that nowadays\nsound embarrassing. Jobs wanted Apple “to become a wonderful consumer products\ncompany,”  Sculley  wrote.  “This  was  a  lunatic  plan.  ...  Apple  would  never  be  a\nconsumer products company. ... We couldn’t bend reality to all our dreams of changing\nthe world. ... High tech could not be designed and sold as a consumer product.”\nJobs was appalled, and he became angry and contemptuous as Sculley presided over\na steady decline in market share for Apple in the early 1990s. “Sculley destroyed Apple\nby bringing in corrupt people and corrupt values,” Jobs later lamented. “They cared\nabout making money—for themselves mainly, and also for Apple—rather than making\ngreat products.” He felt that Sculley’s drive for profits came at the expense of gaining\nmarket share. “Macintosh lost to Microsoft because Sculley insisted on milking all the\nprofits he could get rather than improving the product and making it affordable.” As a\nresult, the profits eventually disappeared.\nIt had taken Microsoft a few years to replicate Macintosh’s graphical user interface,\nbut by 1990 it had come out with Windows 3.0, which began the company’s march to\ndominance in the desktop market. Windows 95, which was released in 1995, became\nthe  most  successful  operating  system  ever,  and  Macintosh  sales  began  to  collapse.\n“Microsoft simply ripped off what other people did,” Jobs later said. “Apple deserved\nit. After I left, it didn’t invent anything new. The Mac hardly improved. It was a sitting\nduck for Microsoft.”\nHis frustration with Apple was evident when he gave a talk to a Stanford Business\nSchool club at the home of a student, who asked him to sign a Macintosh keyboard. Jobs\nagreed to do so if he could remove the keys that had been added to the Mac after he left.\nHe pulled out his car keys and pried off the four arrow cursor keys, which he had once\nbanned, as well as the top row of F1, F2, F3 ... function keys. “I’m changing the world\none keyboard at a time,” he deadpanned. Then he signed the mutilated keyboard.\nDuring his 1995 Christmas vacation in Kona Village, Hawaii, Jobs went walking\nalong the beach with his friend Larry Ellison, the irrepressible Oracle chairman. They\ndiscussed making a takeover bid for Apple and restoring Jobs as its head. Ellison said\nhe could line up $3 billion in financing: “I will buy Apple, you will get 25% of it right\naway for being CEO, and we can restore it to its past glory.” But Jobs demurred. “I\ndecided I’m not a hostile-takeover kind of guy,” he explained. “If they had asked me to\ncome back, it might have been different.”\nBy 1996 Apple’s share of the market had fallen to 4% from a high of 16% in the late\n1980s. Michael Spindler, the German-born chief of Apple’s European operations who\nhad replaced Sculley as CEO in 1993, tried to sell the company to Sun, IBM, and\n\nHewlett-Packard. That failed, and he was ousted in February 1996 and replaced by Gil\nAmelio, a research engineer who was CEO of National Semiconductor. During his first\nyear the company lost $1 billion, and the stock price, which had been $70 in 1991, fell\nto $14, even as the tech bubble was pushing other stocks into the stratosphere.\nAmelio was not a fan of Jobs. Their first meeting had been in 1994, just after Amelio\nwas elected to the Apple board. Jobs had called him and announced, “I want to come\nover and see you.” Amelio invited him over to his office at National Semiconductor,\nand he later recalled watching through the glass wall of his office as Jobs arrived. He\nlooked “rather like a boxer, aggressive and elusively graceful, or like an elegant jungle\ncat ready to spring at its prey.” After a few minutes of pleasantries—far more than Jobs\nusually engaged in—he abruptly announced the reason for his visit. He wanted Amelio\nto help him return to Apple as the CEO. “There’s only one person who can rally the\nApple troops,” Jobs said, “only one person who can straighten out the company.” The\nMacintosh  era  had  passed,  Jobs  argued,  and  it  was  now  time  for  Apple  to  create\nsomething new that was just as innovative.\n“If the Mac is dead, what’s going to replace it?” Amelio asked. Jobs’s reply didn’t\nimpress  him.  “Steve  didn’t  seem  to  have  a  clear  answer,”  Amelio  later  said.  “He\nseemed  to  have  a  set  of  one-liners.”  Amelio  felt  he  was  witnessing  Jobs’s  reality\ndistortion field and was proud to be immune to it. He shooed Jobs unceremoniously out\nof his office.\nBy the summer of 1996 Amelio realized that he had a serious problem. Apple was\npinning its hopes on creating a new operating system, called Copland, but Amelio had\ndiscovered soon after becoming CEO that it was a bloated piece of vaporware that\nwould not solve Apple’s needs for better networking and memory protection, nor would\nit be ready to ship as scheduled in 1997. He publicly promised that he would quickly\nfind an alternative. His problem was that he didn’t have one.\nSo  Apple  needed  a  partner,  one  that  could  make  a  stable  operating  system,\npreferably one that was UNIX-like and had an object-oriented application layer. There\nwas one company that could obviously supply such software—NeXT—but it would\ntake a while for Apple to focus on it.\nApple first homed in on a company that had been started by Jean-Louis Gassée,\ncalled Be. Gassée began negotiating the sale of Be to Apple, but in August 1996 he\noverplayed his hand at a meeting with Amelio in Hawaii. He said he wanted to bring\nhis fifty-person team to Apple, and he asked for 15% of the company, worth about $500\nmillion. Amelio was stunned. Apple calculated that Be was worth about $50 million.\nAfter a few offers and counteroffers, Gassée refused to budge from demanding at least\n$275 million. He thought that Apple had no alternatives. It got back to Amelio that\nGassée said, “I’ve got them by the balls, and I’m going to squeeze until it hurts.” This\ndid not please Amelio.\nApple’s chief technology officer, Ellen Hancock, argued for going with Sun’s UNIX-\nbased Solaris operating system, even though it did not yet have a friendly user interface.\n\nAmelio began to favor using, of all things, Microsoft’s Windows NT, which he felt\ncould  be  rejiggered  on  the  surface  to  look  and  feel  just  like  a  Mac  while  being\ncompatible with the wide range of software available to Windows users. Bill Gates,\neager to make a deal, began personally calling Amelio.\nThere was, of course, one other option. Two years earlier Macworld  magazine\ncolumnist  (and  former  Apple  software  evangelist)  Guy  Kawasaki  had  published  a\nparody press release joking that Apple was buying NeXT and making Jobs its CEO. In\nthe spoof Mike Markkula asked Jobs, “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling\nUNIX with a sugarcoating, or change the world?” Jobs responded, “Because I’m now a\nfather, I needed a steadier source of income.” The release noted that “because of his\nexperience  at  Next,  he  is  expected  to  bring  a  newfound  sense  of  humility  back  to\nApple.” It also quoted Bill Gates as saying there would now be more innovations from\nJobs that Microsoft could copy. Everything in the press release was meant as a joke, of\ncourse. But reality has an odd habit of catching up with satire.\nSlouching toward Cupertino\n“Does anyone know Steve well enough to call him on this?” Amelio asked his staff.\nBecause his encounter with Jobs two years earlier had ended badly, Amelio didn’t want\nto make the call himself. But as it turned out, he didn’t need to. Apple was already\ngetting incoming pings from NeXT. A midlevel product marketer at NeXT, Garrett Rice,\nhad simply picked up the phone and, without consulting Jobs, called Ellen Hancock to\nsee if she might be interested in taking a look at its software. She sent someone to meet\nwith him.\nBy Thanksgiving of 1996 the two companies had begun midlevel talks, and Jobs\npicked up the phone to call Amelio directly. “I’m on my way to Japan, but I’ll be back\nin a week and I’d like to see you as soon as I return,” he said. “Don’t make any decision\nuntil  we  can  get  together.”  Amelio,  despite  his  earlier  experience  with  Jobs,  was\nthrilled to hear from him and entranced by the possibility of working with him. “For me,\nthe phone call with Steve was like inhaling the flavors of a great bottle of vintage\nwine,” he recalled. He gave his assurance he would make no deal with Be or anyone\nelse before they got together.\nFor Jobs, the contest against Be was both professional and personal. NeXT was\nfailing, and the prospect of being bought by Apple was a tantalizing lifeline. In addition,\nJobs held grudges, sometimes passionately, and Gassée was near the top of his list,\ndespite the fact that they had seemed to reconcile when Jobs was at NeXT. “Gassée is\none of the few people in my life I would say is truly horrible,” Jobs later insisted,\nunfairly. “He knifed me in the back in 1985.” Sculley, to his credit, had at least been\ngentlemanly enough to knife Jobs in the front.\n\nOn December 2, 1996, Steve Jobs set foot on Apple’s Cupertino campus for the first\ntime since his ouster eleven years earlier. In the executive conference room, he met\nAmelio and Hancock to make the pitch for NeXT. Once again he was scribbling on the\nwhiteboard there, this time giving his lecture about the four waves of computer systems\nthat had culminated, at least in his telling, with the launch of NeXT. He was at his most\nseductive, despite the fact that he was speaking to two people he didn’t respect. He was\nparticularly adroit at feigning modesty. “It’s probably a totally crazy idea,” he said, but\nif  they  found  it  appealing,  “I’ll  structure  any  kind  of  deal  you  want—license  the\nsoftware, sell you the company, whatever.” He was, in fact, eager to sell everything, and\nhe pushed that approach. “When you take a close look, you’ll decide you want more\nthan my software,” he told them. “You’ll want to buy the whole company and take all the\npeople.”\nA few weeks later Jobs and his family went to Hawaii for Christmas vacation. Larry\nEllison was also there, as he had been the year before. “You know, Larry, I think I’ve\nfound a way for me to get back into Apple and get control of it without you having to\nbuy it,” Jobs said as they walked along the shore. Ellison recalled, “He explained his\nstrategy, which was getting Apple to buy NeXT, then he would go on the board and be\none step away from being CEO.” Ellison thought that Jobs was missing a key point.\n“But Steve, there’s one thing I don’t understand,” he said. “If we don’t buy the company,\nhow can we make any money?” It was a reminder of how different their desires were.\nJobs put his hand on Ellison’s left shoulder, pulled him so close that their noses almost\ntouched, and said, “Larry, this is why it’s really important that I’m your friend. You\ndon’t need any more money.”\nEllison recalled that his own answer was almost a whine: “Well, I may not need the\nmoney, but why should some fund manager at Fidelity get the money? Why should\nsomeone else get it? Why shouldn’t it be us?”\n“I think if I went back to Apple, and I didn’t own any of Apple, and you didn’t own\nany of Apple, I’d have the moral high ground,” Jobs replied.\n“Steve, that’s really expensive real estate, this moral high ground,” said Ellison.\n“Look, Steve, you’re my best friend, and Apple is your company. I’ll do whatever you\nwant.” Although Jobs later said that he was not plotting to take over Apple at the time,\nEllison thought it was inevitable. “Anyone who spent more than a half hour with Amelio\nwould realize that he couldn’t do anything but self-destruct,” he later said.\nThe big bakeoff between NeXT and Be was held at the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto\non December 10, in front of Amelio, Hancock, and six other Apple executives. NeXT\nwent first, with Avie Tevanian demonstrating the software while Jobs displayed his\nhypnotizing salesmanship. They showed how the software could play four video clips\non the screen at once, create multimedia, and link to the Internet. “Steve’s sales pitch on\n\nthe NeXT operating system was dazzling,” according to Amelio. “He praised the virtues\nand strengths as though he were describing a performance of Olivier as Macbeth.”\nGassée  came  in  afterward,  but  he  acted  as  if  he  had  the  deal  in  his  hand.  He\nprovided no new presentation. He simply said that the Apple team knew the capabilities\nof the Be OS and asked if they had any further questions. It was a short session. While\nGassée was presenting, Jobs and Tevanian walked the streets of Palo Alto. After a\nwhile they bumped into one of the Apple executives who had been at the meetings.\n“You’re going to win this,” he told them.\nTevanian later said that this was no surprise: “We had better technology, we had a\nsolution that was complete, and we had Steve.” Amelio knew that bringing Jobs back\ninto the fold would be a double-edged sword, but the same was true of bringing Gassée\nback. Larry Tesler, one of the Macintosh veterans from the old days, recommended to\nAmelio that he choose NeXT, but added, “Whatever company you choose, you’ll get\nsomeone who will take your job away, Steve or Jean-Louis.”\nAmelio opted for Jobs. He called Jobs to say that he planned to propose to the\nApple board that he be authorized to negotiate a purchase of NeXT. Would he like to be\nat the meeting? Jobs said he would. When he walked in, there was an emotional moment\nwhen he saw Mike Markkula. They had not spoken since Markkula, once his mentor and\nfather figure, had sided with Sculley there back in 1985. Jobs walked over and shook\nhis hand.\nJobs invited Amelio to come to his house in Palo Alto so they could negotiate in a\nfriendly  setting.  When  Amelio  arrived  in  his  classic  1973  Mercedes,  Jobs  was\nimpressed; he liked the car. In the kitchen, which had finally been renovated, Jobs put a\nkettle on for tea, and then they sat at the wooden table in front of the open-hearth pizza\noven. The financial part of the negotiations went smoothly; Jobs was eager not to make\nGassée’s mistake of overreaching. He suggested that Apple pay $12 a share for NeXT.\nThat would amount to about $500 million. Amelio said that was too high. He countered\nwith $10 a share, or just over $400 million. Unlike Be, NeXT had an actual product,\nreal revenues, and a great team, but Jobs was nevertheless pleasantly surprised at that\ncounteroffer. He accepted immediately.\nOne sticking point was that Jobs wanted his payout to be in cash. Amelio insisted\nthat he needed to “have skin in the game” and take the payout in stock that he would\nagree to hold for at least a year. Jobs resisted. Finally, they compromised: Jobs would\ntake $120 million in cash and $37 million in stock, and he pledged to hold the stock for\nat least six months.\nAs usual Jobs wanted to have some of their conversation while taking a walk. While\nthey ambled around Palo Alto, he made a pitch to be put on Apple’s board. Amelio tried\nto deflect it, saying there was too much history to do something like that too quickly.\n“Gil, that really hurts,” Jobs said. “This was my company. I’ve been left out since that\nhorrible day with Sculley.” Amelio said he understood, but he was not sure what the\nboard would want. When he was about to begin his negotiations with Jobs, he had made\n\na  mental  note  to  “move  ahead  with  logic  as  my  drill  sergeant”  and  “sidestep  the\ncharisma.” But during the walk he, like so many others, was caught in Jobs’s force field.\n“I was hooked in by Steve’s energy and enthusiasm,” he recalled.\nAfter circling the long blocks a couple of times, they returned to the house just as\nLaurene and the kids were arriving home. They all celebrated the easy negotiations, then\nAmelio rode off in his Mercedes. “He made me feel like a lifelong friend,” Amelio\nrecalled. Jobs indeed had a way of doing that. Later, after Jobs had engineered his\nouster, Amelio would look back on Jobs’s friendliness that day and note wistfully, “As I\nwould painfully discover, it was merely one facet of an extremely complex personality.”\nAfter informing Gassée that Apple was buying NeXT, Amelio had what turned out to\nbe an even more uncomfortable task: telling Bill Gates. “He went into orbit,” Amelio\nrecalled. Gates found it ridiculous, but perhaps not surprising, that Jobs had pulled off\nthis coup. “Do you really think Steve Jobs has anything there?” Gates asked Amelio. “I\nknow his technology, it’s nothing but a warmed-over UNIX, and you’ll never be able to\nmake it work on your machines.” Gates, like Jobs, had a way of working himself up,\nand he did so now: “Don’t you understand that Steve doesn’t know anything about\ntechnology? He’s just a super salesman. I can’t believe you’re making such a stupid\ndecision. ... He doesn’t know anything about engineering, and 99% of what he says and\nthinks is wrong. What the hell are you buying that garbage for?”\nYears later, when I raised it with him, Gates did not recall being that upset. The\npurchase  of  NeXT,  he  argued,  did  not  really  give  Apple  a  new  operating  system.\n“Amelio paid a lot for NeXT, and let’s be frank, the NeXT OS was never really used.”\nInstead the purchase ended up bringing in Avie Tevanian, who could help the existing\nApple operating system evolve so that it eventually incorporated the kernel of the NeXT\ntechnology. Gates knew that the deal was destined to bring Jobs back to power. “But\nthat was a twist of fate,” he said. “What they ended up buying was a guy who most\npeople would not have predicted would be a great CEO, because he didn’t have much\nexperience at it, but he was a brilliant guy with great design taste and great engineering\ntaste. He suppressed his craziness enough to get himself appointed interim CEO.”\nDespite what both Ellison and Gates believed, Jobs had deeply conflicted feelings\nabout whether he wanted to return to an active role at Apple, at least while Amelio was\nthere. A few days before the NeXT purchase was due to be announced, Amelio asked\nJobs to rejoin Apple full-time and take charge of operating system development. Jobs,\nhowever, kept deflecting Amelio’s request.\nFinally, on the day that he was scheduled to make the big announcement, Amelio\ncalled Jobs in. He needed an answer. “Steve, do you just want to take your money and\nleave?” Amelio asked. “It’s okay if that’s what you want.” Jobs did not answer; he just\nstared. “Do you want to be on the payroll? An advisor?” Again Jobs stayed silent.\nAmelio went out and grabbed Jobs’s lawyer, Larry Sonsini, and asked what he thought\n\nJobs wanted. “Beats me,” Sonsini said. So Amelio went back behind closed doors with\nJobs and gave it one more try. “Steve, what’s on your mind? What are you feeling?\nPlease, I need a decision now.”\n“I didn’t get any sleep last night,” Jobs replied.\n“Why? What’s the problem?”\n“I was thinking about all the things that need to be done and about the deal we’re\nmaking, and it’s all running together for me. I’m really tired now and not thinking\nclearly. I just don’t want to be asked any more questions.”\nAmelio said that wasn’t possible. He needed to say something.\nFinally Jobs answered, “Look, if you have to tell them something, just say advisor to\nthe chairman.” And that is what Amelio did.\nThe announcement was made that evening—December 20, 1996—in front of 250\ncheering  employees  at  Apple  headquarters.  Amelio  did  as  Jobs  had  requested  and\ndescribed his new role as merely that of a part-time advisor. Instead of appearing from\nthe wings of the stage, Jobs walked in from the rear of the auditorium and ambled down\nthe aisle. Amelio had told the gathering that Jobs would be too tired to say anything, but\nby then he had been energized by the applause. “I’m very excited,” Jobs said. “I’m\nlooking forward to get to reknow some old colleagues.” Louise Kehoe of the Financial\nTimes came up to the stage afterward and asked Jobs, sounding almost accusatory,\nwhether he was going to end up taking over Apple. “Oh no, Louise,” he said. “There are\na lot of other things going on in my life now. I have a family. I am involved at Pixar. My\ntime is limited, but I hope I can share some ideas.”\nThe next day Jobs drove to Pixar. He had fallen increasingly in love with the place,\nand he wanted to let the crew there know he was still going to be president and deeply\ninvolved. But the Pixar people were happy to see him go back to Apple part-time; a\nlittle less of Jobs’s focus would be a good thing. He was useful when there were big\nnegotiations, but he could be dangerous when he had too much time on his hands. When\nhe arrived at Pixar that day, he went to Lasseter’s office and explained that even just\nbeing an advisor at Apple would take up a lot of his time. He said he wanted Lasseter’s\nblessing. “I keep thinking about all the time away from my family this will cause, and\nthe time away from the other family at Pixar,” Jobs said. “But the only reason I want to\ndo it is that the world will be a better place with Apple in it.”\nLasseter smiled gently. “You have my blessing,” he said.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\nTHE RESTORATION\nThe Loser Now Will Be Later to Win\nAmelio calling up Wozniak as Jobs hangs back, 1997\nHovering Backstage\n“It’s  rare  that  you  see  an  artist  in  his  thirties  or  forties  able  to  really  contribute\nsomething amazing,” Jobs declared as he was about to turn thirty.\nThat held true for Jobs in his thirties, during the decade that began with his ouster\nfrom Apple in 1985. But after turning forty in 1995, he flourished. Toy  Story was\nreleased  that  year,  and  the  following  year  Apple’s  purchase  of  NeXT  offered  him\nreentry into the company he had founded. In returning to Apple, Jobs would show that\neven  people  over  forty  could  be  great  innovators.  Having  transformed  personal\ncomputers in his twenties, he would now help to do the same for music players, the\n\nrecording industry’s business model, mobile phones, apps, tablet computers, books, and\njournalism.\nHe had told Larry Ellison that his return strategy was to sell NeXT to Apple, get\nappointed to the board, and be there ready when CEO Gil Amelio stumbled. Ellison\nmay have been baffled when Jobs insisted that he was not motivated by money, but it\nwas partly true. He had neither Ellison’s conspicuous consumption needs nor Gates’s\nphilanthropic impulses nor the competitive urge to see how high on the Forbes list he\ncould get. Instead his ego needs and personal drives led him to seek fulfillment by\ncreating a legacy that would awe people. A dual legacy, actually: building innovative\nproducts and building a lasting company. He wanted to be in the pantheon with, indeed a\nnotch above, people like Edwin Land, Bill Hewlett, and David Packard. And the best\nway to achieve all this was to return to Apple and reclaim his kingdom.\nAnd  yet  when  the  cup  of  power  neared  his  lips,  he  became  strangely  hesitant,\nreluctant, perhaps coy.\nHe returned to Apple officially in January 1997 as a part-time advisor, as he had\ntold Amelio he would. He began to assert himself in some personnel areas, especially\nin protecting his people who had made the transition from NeXT. But in most other\nways he was unusually passive. The decision not to ask him to join the board offended\nhim, and he felt demeaned by the suggestion that he run the company’s operating system\ndivision. Amelio was thus able to create a situation in which Jobs was both inside the\ntent  and  outside  the  tent,  which  was  not  a  prescription  for  tranquillity.  Jobs  later\nrecalled:\nGil didn’t want me around. And I thought he was a bozo. I knew that before I sold him\nthe company. I thought I was just going to be trotted out now and then for events like\nMacworld, mainly for show. That was fine, because I was working at Pixar. I rented an\noffice in downtown Palo Alto where I could work a few days a week, and I drove up to\nPixar for one or two days. It was a nice life. I could slow down, spend time with my\nfamily.\nJobs was, in fact, trotted out for Macworld right at the beginning of January, and this\nreaffirmed his opinion that Amelio was a bozo. Close to four thousand of the faithful\nfought for seats in the ballroom of the San Francisco Marriott to hear Amelio’s keynote\naddress. He was introduced by the actor Jeff Goldblum. “I play an expert in chaos\ntheory in The Lost World: Jurassic Park,” he said. “I figure that will qualify me to\nspeak at an Apple event.” He then turned it over to Amelio, who came onstage wearing\na flashy sports jacket and a banded-collar shirt buttoned tight at the neck, “looking like a\nVegas comic,” the Wall Street Journal reporter Jim Carlton noted, or in the words of the\n\ntechnology writer Michael Malone, “looking exactly like your newly divorced uncle on\nhis first date.”\nThe bigger problem was that Amelio had gone on vacation, gotten into a nasty tussle\nwith his speechwriters, and refused to rehearse. When Jobs arrived backstage, he was\nupset by the chaos, and he seethed as Amelio stood on the podium bumbling through a\ndisjointed and endless presentation. Amelio was unfamiliar with the talking points that\npopped up on his teleprompter and soon was trying to wing his presentation. Repeatedly\nhe lost his train of thought. After more than an hour, the audience was aghast. There\nwere a few welcome breaks, such as when he brought out the singer Peter Gabriel to\ndemonstrate a new music program. He also pointed out Muhammad Ali in the first row;\nthe  champ  was  supposed  to  come  onstage  to  promote  a  website  about  Parkinson’s\ndisease, but Amelio never invited him up or explained why he was there.\nAmelio rambled for more than two hours before he finally called onstage the person\neveryone was waiting to cheer. “Jobs, exuding confidence, style, and sheer magnetism,\nwas the antithesis of the fumbling Amelio as he strode onstage,” Carlton wrote. “The\nreturn of Elvis would not have provoked a bigger sensation.” The crowd jumped to its\nfeet and gave him a raucous ovation for more than a minute. The wilderness decade was\nover. Finally Jobs waved for silence and cut to the heart of the challenge. “We’ve got to\nget the spark back,” he said. “The Mac didn’t progress much in ten years. So Windows\ncaught up. So we have to come up with an OS that’s even better.”\nJobs’s  pep  talk  could  have  been  a  redeeming  finale  to  Amelio’s  frightening\nperformance. Unfortunately Amelio came back onstage and resumed his ramblings for\nanother hour. Finally, more than three hours after the show began, Amelio brought it to a\nclose by calling Jobs back onstage and then, in a surprise, bringing up Steve Wozniak as\nwell.  Again  there  was  pandemonium.  But  Jobs  was  clearly  annoyed.  He  avoided\nengaging in a triumphant trio scene, arms in the air. Instead he slowly edged offstage.\n“He ruthlessly ruined the closing moment I had planned,” Amelio later complained.\n“His own feelings were more important than good press for Apple.” It was only seven\ndays into the new year for Apple, and already it was clear that the center would not\nhold.\nJobs immediately put people he trusted into the top ranks at Apple. “I wanted to make\nsure the really good people who came in from NeXT didn’t get knifed in the back by the\nless competent people who were then in senior jobs at Apple,” he recalled. Ellen\nHancock, who had favored choosing Sun’s Solaris over NeXT, was on the top of his\nbozo list, especially when she continued to want to use the kernel of Solaris in the new\nApple operating system. In response to a reporter’s question about the role Jobs would\nplay in making that decision, she answered curtly, “None.” She was wrong. Jobs’s first\nmove was to make sure that two of his friends from NeXT took over her duties.\n\nTo  head  software  engineering,  he  tapped  his  buddy  Avie  Tevanian.  To  run  the\nhardware side, he called on Jon Rubinstein, who had done the same at NeXT back when\nit had a hardware division. Rubinstein was vacationing on the Isle of Skye when Jobs\ncalled  him.  “Apple  needs  some  help,”  he  said.  “Do  you  want  to  come  aboard?”\nRubinstein did. He got back in time to attend Macworld and see Amelio bomb onstage.\nThings were worse than he expected. He and Tevanian would exchange glances at\nmeetings as if they had stumbled into an insane asylum, with people making deluded\nassertions while Amelio sat at the end of the table in a seeming stupor.\nJobs did not come into the office regularly, but he was on the phone to Amelio often.\nOnce he had succeeded in making sure that Tevanian, Rubinstein, and others he trusted\nwere given top positions, he turned his focus onto the sprawling product line. One of his\npet  peeves  was  Newton,  the  handheld  personal  digital  assistant  that  boasted\nhandwriting recognition capability. It was not quite as bad as the jokes and Doonesbury\ncomic strip made it seem, but Jobs hated it. He disdained the idea of having a stylus or\npen for writing on a screen. “God gave us ten styluses,” he would say, waving his\nfingers. “Let’s not invent another.” In addition, he viewed Newton as John Sculley’s one\nmajor innovation, his pet project. That alone doomed it in Jobs’s eyes.\n“You ought to kill Newton,” he told Amelio one day by phone.\nIt was a suggestion out of the blue, and Amelio pushed back. “What do you mean,\nkill it?” he said. “Steve, do you have any idea how expensive that would be?”\n“Shut it down, write it off, get rid of it,” said Jobs. “It doesn’t matter what it costs.\nPeople will cheer you if you got rid of it.”\n“I’ve looked into Newton and it’s going to be a moneymaker,” Amelio declared. “I\ndon’t support getting rid of it.” By May, however, he announced plans to spin off the\nNewton division, the beginning of its yearlong stutter-step march to the grave.\nTevanian and Rubinstein would come by Jobs’s house to keep him informed, and\nsoon much of Silicon Valley knew that Jobs was quietly wresting power from Amelio. It\nwas not so much a Machiavellian power play as it was Jobs being Jobs. Wanting\ncontrol was ingrained in his nature. Louise Kehoe, the Financial Times reporter who\nhad foreseen this when she questioned Jobs and Amelio at the December announcement,\nwas the first with the story. “Mr. Jobs has become the power behind the throne,” she\nreported at the end of February. “He is said to be directing decisions on which parts of\nApple’s  operations  should  be  cut.  Mr.  Jobs  has  urged  a  number  of  former  Apple\ncolleagues to return to the company, hinting strongly that he plans to take charge, they\nsaid. According to one of Mr. Jobs’ confidantes, he has decided that Mr. Amelio and his\nappointees are unlikely to succeed in reviving Apple, and he is intent upon replacing\nthem to ensure the survival of ‘his company.’”\nThat month Amelio had to face the annual stockholders meeting and explain why the\nresults for the final quarter of 1996 showed a 30% plummet in sales from the year\nbefore.  Shareholders  lined  up  at  the  microphones  to  vent  their  anger.  Amelio  was\nclueless about how poorly he handled the meeting. “The presentation was regarded as\n\none of the best I had ever given,” he later wrote. But Ed Woolard, the former CEO of\nDuPont who was now the chair of the Apple board (Markkula had been demoted to vice\nchair), was appalled. “This is a disaster,” his wife whispered to him in the midst of the\nsession. Woolard agreed. “Gil came dressed real cool, but he looked and sounded\nsilly,” he recalled. “He couldn’t answer the questions, didn’t know what he was talking\nabout, and didn’t inspire any confidence.”\nWoolard picked up the phone and called Jobs, whom he’d never met. The pretext\nwas to invite him to Delaware to speak to DuPont executives. Jobs declined, but as\nWoolard recalled, “the request was a ruse in order to talk to him about Gil.” He steered\nthe phone call in that direction and asked Jobs point-blank what his impression of\nAmelio  was.  Woolard  remembers  Jobs  being  somewhat  circumspect,  saying  that\nAmelio was not in the right job. Jobs recalled being more blunt:\nI thought to myself, I either tell him the truth, that Gil is a bozo, or I lie by omission.\nHe’s on the board of Apple, I have a duty to tell him what I think; on the other hand, if I\ntell him, he will tell Gil, in which case Gil will never listen to me again. All of this\ntook place in my head in less than thirty seconds. I finally decided that I owed this guy\nthe truth. I cared deeply about Apple. So I just let him have it. I said this guy is the\nworst CEO I’ve ever seen, I think if you needed a license to be a CEO he wouldn’t get\none. When I hung up the phone, I thought, I probably just did a really stupid thing.\nThat spring Larry Ellison saw Amelio at a party and introduced him to the technology\njournalist Gina Smith, who asked how Apple was doing. “You know, Gina, Apple is\nlike a ship,” Amelio answered. “That ship is loaded with treasure, but there’s a hole in\nthe ship. And my job is to get everyone to row in the same direction.” Smith looked\nperplexed and asked, “Yeah, but what about the hole?” From then on, Ellison and Jobs\njoked about the parable of the ship. “When Larry relayed this story to me, we were in\nthis sushi place, and I literally fell off my chair laughing,” Jobs recalled. “He was just\nsuch a buffoon, and he took himself so seriously. He insisted that everyone call him Dr.\nAmelio. That’s always a warning sign.”\nBrent Schlender, Fortune’s well-sourced technology reporter, knew Jobs and was\nfamiliar with his thinking, and in March he came out with a story detailing the mess.\n“Apple Computer, Silicon Valley’s paragon of dysfunctional management and fumbled\ntechno-dreams, is back in crisis mode, scrambling lugubriously in slow motion to deal\nwith  imploding  sales,  a  floundering  technology  strategy,  and  a  hemorrhaging  brand\nname,” he wrote. “To the Machiavellian eye, it looks as if Jobs, despite the lure of\nHollywood—lately  he  has  been  overseeing  Pixar,  maker  of Toy  Story  and  other\ncomputer-animated films—might be scheming to take over Apple.”\n\nOnce  again  Ellison  publicly  floated  the  idea  of  doing  a  hostile  takeover  and\ninstalling his “best friend” Jobs as CEO. “Steve’s the only one who can save Apple,” he\ntold reporters. “I’m ready to help him the minute he says the word.” Like the third time\nthe boy cried wolf, Ellison’s latest takeover musings didn’t get much notice, so later in\nthe month he told Dan Gillmore of the San Jose Mercury News that he was forming an\ninvestor group to raise $1 billion to buy a majority stake in Apple. (The company’s\nmarket value was about $2.3 billion.) The day the story came out, Apple stock shot up\n11%  in  heavy  trading.  To  add  to  the  frivolity,  Ellison  set  up  an  email  address,\nsavapple@us.oracle.com, asking the general public to vote on whether he should go\nahead with it.\nJobs was somewhat amused by Ellison’s self-appointed role. “Larry brings this up\nnow and then,” he told a reporter. “I try to explain my role at Apple is to be an advisor.”\nAmelio, however, was livid. He called Ellison to dress him down, but Ellison wouldn’t\ntake the call. So Amelio called Jobs, whose response was equivocal but also partly\ngenuine. “I really don’t understand what is going on,” he told Amelio. “I think all this is\ncrazy.” Then he added a reassurance that was not at all genuine: “You and I have a good\nrelationship.” Jobs could have ended the speculation by releasing a statement rejecting\nEllison’s idea, but much to Amelio’s annoyance, he didn’t. He remained aloof, which\nserved both his interests and his nature.\nBy then the press had turned against Amelio. Business Week ran a cover asking “Is\nApple  Mincemeat?”; Red  Herring  ran  an  editorial  headlined  “Gil  Amelio,  Please\nResign”; and Wired ran a cover that showed the Apple logo crucified as a sacred heart\nwith a crown of thorns and the headline “Pray.” Mike Barnicle of the Boston Globe,\nrailing against years of Apple mismanagement, wrote, “How can these nitwits still draw\na paycheck when they took the only computer that didn’t frighten people and turned it\ninto the technological equivalent of the 1997 Red Sox bullpen?”\nWhen Jobs and Amelio had signed the contract in February, Jobs began hopping around\nexuberantly and declared, “You and I need to go out and have a great bottle of wine to\ncelebrate!” Amelio offered to bring wine from his cellar and suggested that they invite\ntheir wives. It took until June before they settled on a date, and despite the rising\ntensions they were able to have a good time. The food and wine were as mismatched as\nthe diners; Amelio brought a bottle of 1964 Cheval Blanc and a Montrachet that each\ncost about $300; Jobs chose a vegetarian restaurant in Redwood City where the food\nbill totaled $72. Amelio’s wife remarked afterward, “He’s such a charmer, and his wife\nis too.”\nJobs could seduce and charm people at will, and he liked to do so. People such as\nAmelio and Sculley allowed themselves to believe that because Jobs was charming\nthem, it meant that he liked and respected them. It was an impression that he sometimes\nfostered by dishing out insincere flattery to those hungry for it. But Jobs could be\n\ncharming to people he hated just as easily as he could be insulting to people he liked.\nAmelio didn’t see this because, like Sculley, he was so eager for Jobs’s affection.\nIndeed the words he used to describe his yearning for a good relationship with Jobs are\nalmost the same as those used by Sculley. “When I was wrestling with a problem, I\nwould walk through the issue with him,” Amelio recalled. “Nine times out of ten we\nwould agree.” Somehow he willed himself to believe that Jobs really respected him: “I\nwas in awe over the way Steve’s mind approached problems, and had the feeling we\nwere building a mutually trusting relationship.”\nAmelio’s  disillusionment  came  a  few  days  after  their  dinner.  During  their\nnegotiations, he had insisted that Jobs hold the Apple stock he got for at least six\nmonths, and preferably longer. That six months ended in June. When a block of 1.5\nmillion shares was sold, Amelio called Jobs. “I’m telling people that the shares sold\nwere not yours,” he said. “Remember, you and I had an understanding that you wouldn’t\nsell any without advising us first.”\n“That’s right,” Jobs replied. Amelio took that response to mean that Jobs had not\nsold his shares, and he issued a statement saying so. But when the next SEC filing came\nout, it revealed that Jobs had indeed sold the shares. “Dammit, Steve, I asked you point-\nblank about these shares and you denied it was you.” Jobs told Amelio that he had sold\nin a “fit of depression” about where Apple was going and he didn’t want to admit it\nbecause he was “a little embarrassed.” When I asked him about it years later, he simply\nsaid, “I didn’t feel I needed to tell Gil.”\nWhy did Jobs mislead Amelio about selling the shares? One reason is simple: Jobs\nsometimes avoided the truth. Helmut Sonnenfeldt once said of Henry Kissinger, “He lies\nnot because it’s in his interest, he lies because it’s in his nature.” It was in Jobs’s nature\nto mislead or be secretive when he felt it was warranted. But he also indulged in being\nbrutally honest at times, telling the truths that most of us sugarcoat or suppress. Both the\ndissembling  and  the  truth-telling  were  simply  different  aspects  of  his  Nietzschean\nattitude that ordinary rules didn’t apply to him.\nExit, Pursued by a Bear\nJobs had refused to quash Larry Ellison’s takeover talk, and he had secretly sold his\nshares and been misleading about it. So Amelio finally became convinced that Jobs was\ngunning for him. “I finally absorbed the fact that I had been too willing and too eager to\nbelieve  he  was  on  my  team,”  Amelio  recalled.  “Steve’s  plans  to  manipulate  my\ntermination were charging forward.”\nJobs  was  indeed  bad-mouthing  Amelio  at  every  opportunity.  He  couldn’t  help\nhimself. But there was a more important factor in turning the board against Amelio. Fred\nAnderson, the chief financial officer, saw it as his fiduciary duty to keep Ed Woolard\n\nand the board informed of Apple’s dire situation. “Fred was the guy telling me that cash\nwas draining, people were leaving, and more key players were thinking of it,” said\nWoolard. “He made it clear the ship was going to hit the sand soon, and even he was\nthinking of leaving.” That added to the worries Woolard already had from watching\nAmelio bumble the shareholders meeting.\nAt an executive session of the board in June, with Amelio out of the room, Woolard\ndescribed to current directors how he calculated their odds. “If we stay with Gil as\nCEO, I think there’s only a 10% chance we will avoid bankruptcy,” he said. “If we fire\nhim and convince Steve to come take over, we have a 60% chance of surviving. If we\nfire Gil, don’t get Steve back, and have to search for a new CEO, then we have a 40%\nchance of surviving.” The board gave him authority to ask Jobs to return.\nWoolard  and  his  wife  flew  to  London,  where  they  were  planning  to  watch  the\nWimbledon tennis matches. He saw some of the tennis during the day, but spent his\nevenings in his suite at the Inn on the Park calling people back in America, where it was\ndaytime. By the end of his stay, his telephone bill was $2,000.\nFirst, he called Jobs. The board was going to fire Amelio, he said, and it wanted\nJobs to come back as CEO. Jobs had been aggressive in deriding Amelio and pushing\nhis own ideas about where to take Apple. But suddenly, when offered the cup, he\nbecame coy. “I will help,” he replied.\n“As CEO?” Woolard asked.\nJobs said no. Woolard pushed hard for him to become at least the acting CEO. Again\nJobs demurred. “I will be an advisor,” he said. “Unpaid.” He also agreed to become a\nboard member—that was something he had yearned for—but declined to be the board\nchairman. “That’s all I can give now,” he said. After rumors began circulating, he\nemailed a memo to Pixar employees assuring them that he was not abandoning them. “I\ngot a call from Apple’s board of directors three weeks ago asking me to return to Apple\nas their CEO,” he wrote. “I declined. They then asked me to become chairman, and I\nagain declined. So don’t worry—the crazy rumors are just that. I have no plans to leave\nPixar. You’re stuck with me.”\nWhy did Jobs not seize the reins? Why was he reluctant to grab the job that for two\ndecades he had seemed to desire? When I asked him, he said:\nWe’d just taken Pixar public, and I was happy being CEO there. I never knew of anyone\nwho served as CEO of two public companies, even temporarily, and I wasn’t even sure\nit was legal. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I was enjoying spending more time with\nmy family. I was torn. I knew Apple was a mess, so I wondered: Do I want to give up\nthis nice lifestyle that I have? What are all the Pixar shareholders going to think? I\ntalked to people I respected. I finally called Andy Grove at about eight one Saturday\nmorning—too early. I gave him the pros and the cons, and in the middle he stopped me\nand said, “Steve, I don’t give a shit about Apple.” I was stunned. It was then I realized\n\nthat I do give a shit about Apple—I started it and it is a good thing to have in the world.\nThat was when I decided to go back on a temporary basis to help them hire a CEO.\nThe claim that he was enjoying spending more time with his family was not convincing.\nHe was never destined to win a Father of the Year trophy, even when he had spare time\non his hands. He was getting better at paying heed to his children, especially Reed, but\nhis primary focus was on his work. He was frequently aloof from his two younger\ndaughters, estranged again from Lisa, and often prickly as a husband.\nSo what was the real reason for his hesitancy in taking over at Apple? For all of his\nwillfulness and insatiable desire to control things, Jobs was indecisive and reticent\nwhen he felt unsure about something. He craved perfection, and he was not always good\nat  figuring  out  how  to  settle  for  something  less.  He  did  not  like  to  wrestle  with\ncomplexity or make accommodations. This was true in products, design, and furnishings\nfor the house. It was also true when it came to personal commitments. If he knew for\nsure  a  course  of  action  was  right,  he  was  unstoppable.  But  if  he  had  doubts,  he\nsometimes withdrew, preferring not to think about things that did not perfectly suit him.\nAs happened when Amelio had asked him what role he wanted to play, Jobs would go\nsilent and ignore situations that made him uncomfortable.\nThis attitude arose partly out of his tendency to see the world in binary terms. A\nperson was either a hero or a bozo, a product was either amazing or shit. But he could\nbe stymied by things that were more complex, shaded, or nuanced: getting married,\nbuying the right sofa, committing to run a company. In addition, he didn’t want to be set\nup for failure. “I think Steve wanted to assess whether Apple could be saved,” Fred\nAnderson said.\nWoolard and the board decided to go ahead and fire Amelio, even though Jobs was\nnot yet forthcoming about how active a role he would play as an advisor. Amelio was\nabout to go on a picnic with his wife, children, and grandchildren when the call came\nfrom Woolard in London. “We need you to step down,” Woolard said simply. Amelio\nreplied that it was not a good time to discuss this, but Woolard felt he had to persist.\n“We are going to announce that we’re replacing you.”\nAmelio resisted. “Remember, Ed, I told the board it was going to take three years to\nget this company back on its feet again,” he said. “I’m not even halfway through.”\n“The board is at the place where we don’t want to discuss it further,” Woolard\nreplied. Amelio asked who knew about the decision, and Woolard told him the truth: the\nrest of the board plus Jobs. “Steve was one of the people we talked to about this,”\nWoolard said. “His view is that you’re a really nice guy, but you don’t know much about\nthe computer industry.”\n“Why  in  the  world  would  you  involve  Steve  in  a  decision  like  this?”  Amelio\nreplied, getting angry. “Steve is not even a member of the board of directors, so what\n\nthe hell is he doing in any of this conversation?” But Woolard didn’t back down, and\nAmelio hung up to carry on with the family picnic before telling his wife.\nAt times Jobs displayed a strange mixture of prickliness and neediness. He usually\ndidn’t care one iota what people thought of him; he could cut people off and never care\nto speak to them again. Yet sometimes he also felt a compulsion to explain himself. So\nthat evening Amelio received, to his surprise, a phone call from Jobs. “Gee, Gil, I just\nwanted you to know, I talked to Ed today about this thing and I really feel bad about it,”\nhe said. “I want you to know that I had absolutely nothing to do with this turn of events,\nit was a decision the board made, but they had asked me for advice and counsel.” He\ntold Amelio he respected him for having “the highest integrity of anyone I’ve ever met,”\nand went on to give some unsolicited advice. “Take six months off,” Jobs told him.\n“When I got thrown out of Apple, I immediately went back to work, and I regretted it.”\nHe offered to be a sounding board if Amelio ever wanted more advice.\nAmelio was stunned but managed to mumble a few words of thanks. He turned to his\nwife and recounted what Jobs said. “In ways, I still like the man, but I don’t believe\nhim,” he told her.\n“I was totally taken in by Steve,” she said, “and I really feel like an idiot.”\n“Join the crowd,” her husband replied.\nSteve Wozniak, who was himself now an informal advisor to the company, was\nthrilled that Jobs was coming back. (He forgave easily.) “It was just what we needed,”\nhe said, “because whatever you think of Steve, he knows how to get the magic back.”\nNor did Jobs’s triumph over Amelio surprise him. As he told Wired shortly after it\nhappened, “Gil Amelio meets Steve Jobs, game over.”\nThat Monday Apple’s top employees were summoned to the auditorium. Amelio\ncame in looking calm and relaxed. “Well, I’m sad to report that it’s time for me to move\non,” he said. Fred Anderson, who had agreed to be interim CEO, spoke next, and he\nmade it clear that he would be taking his cues from Jobs. Then, exactly twelve years\nsince he had lost power in a July 4 weekend struggle, Jobs walked back onstage at\nApple.\nIt immediately became clear that, whether or not he wanted to admit it publicly (or\neven to himself), Jobs was going to take control and not be a mere advisor. As soon as\nhe came onstage that day—wearing shorts, sneakers, and a black turtleneck—he got to\nwork  reinvigorating  his  beloved  institution.  “Okay,  tell  me  what’s  wrong  with  this\nplace,” he said. There were some murmurings, but Jobs cut them off. “It’s the products!”\nhe answered. “So what’s wrong with the products?” Again there were a few attempts at\nan answer, until Jobs broke in to hand down the correct answer. “The products suck!”\nhe shouted. “There’s no sex in them anymore!”\nWoolard was able to coax Jobs to agree that his role as an advisor would be a very\nactive  one.  Jobs  approved  a  statement  saying  that  he  had  “agreed  to  step  up  my\ninvolvement with Apple for up to 90 days, helping them until they hire a new CEO.”\n\nThe clever formulation that Woolard used in his statement was that Jobs was coming\nback “as an advisor leading the team.”\nJobs took a small office next to the boardroom on the executive floor, conspicuously\neschewing Amelio’s big corner office. He got involved in all aspects of the business:\nproduct design, where to cut, supplier negotiations, and advertising agency review. He\nbelieved that he had to stop the hemorrhaging of top Apple employees, and to do so he\nwanted to reprice their stock options. Apple stock had dropped so low that the options\nhad become worthless. Jobs wanted to lower the exercise price, so they would be\nvaluable again. At the time, that was legally permissible, but it was not considered good\ncorporate practice. On his first Thursday back at Apple, Jobs called for a telephonic\nboard meeting and outlined the problem. The directors balked. They asked for time to\ndo a legal and financial study of what the change would mean. “It has to be done fast,”\nJobs told them. “We’re losing good people.”\nEven his supporter Ed Woolard, who headed the compensation committee, objected.\n“At DuPont we never did such a thing,” he said.\n“You brought me here to fix this thing, and people are the key,” Jobs argued. When\nthe  board  proposed  a  study  that  could  take  two  months,  Jobs  exploded:  “Are  you\nnuts?!?” He paused for a long moment of silence, then continued. “Guys, if you don’t\nwant to do this, I’m not coming back on Monday. Because I’ve got thousands of key\ndecisions to make that are far more difficult than this, and if you can’t throw your\nsupport behind this kind of decision, I will fail. So if you can’t do this, I’m out of here,\nand you can blame it on me, you can say, ‘Steve wasn’t up for the job.’”\nThe next day, after consulting with the board, Woolard called Jobs back. “We’re\ngoing to approve this,” he said. “But some of the board members don’t like it. We feel\nlike you’ve put a gun to our head.” The options for the top team (Jobs had none) were\nreset at $13.25, which was the price of the stock the day Amelio was ousted.\nInstead of declaring victory and thanking the board, Jobs continued to seethe at\nhaving to answer to a board he didn’t respect. “Stop the train, this isn’t going to work,”\nhe told Woolard. “This company is in shambles, and I don’t have time to wet-nurse the\nboard. So I need all of you to resign. Or else I’m going to resign and not come back on\nMonday.” The one person who could stay, he said, was Woolard.\nMost members of the board were aghast. Jobs was still refusing to commit himself to\ncoming back full-time or being anything more than an advisor, yet he felt he had the\npower to force them to leave. The hard truth, however, was that he did have that power\nover them. They could not afford for him to storm off in a fury, nor was the prospect of\nremaining an Apple board member very enticing by then. “After all they’d been through,\nmost were glad to be let off,” Woolard recalled.\nOnce again the board acquiesced. It made only one request: Would he permit one\nother director to stay, in addition to Woolard? It would help the optics. Jobs assented.\n“They were an awful board, a terrible board,” he later said. “I agreed they could keep\nEd Woolard and a guy named Gareth Chang, who turned out to be a zero. He wasn’t\n\nterrible, just a zero. Woolard, on the other hand, was one of the best board members\nI’ve ever seen. He was a prince, one of the most supportive and wise people I’ve ever\nmet.”\nAmong those being asked to resign was Mike Markkula, who in 1976, as a young\nventure capitalist, had visited the Jobs garage, fallen in love with the nascent computer\non the workbench, guaranteed a $250,000 line of credit, and become the third partner\nand one-third owner of the new company. Over the subsequent two decades, he was the\none constant on the board, ushering in and out a variety of CEOs. He had supported Jobs\nat times but also clashed with him, most notably when he sided with Sculley in the\nshowdowns of 1985. With Jobs returning, he knew that it was time for him to leave.\nJobs could be cutting and cold, especially toward people who crossed him, but he\ncould also be sentimental about those who had been with him from the early days.\nWozniak fell into that favored category, of course, even though they had drifted apart; so\ndid  Andy  Hertzfeld  and  a  few  others  from  the  Macintosh  team.  In  the  end,  Mike\nMarkkula did as well. “I felt deeply betrayed by him, but he was like a father and I\nalways cared about him,” Jobs later recalled. So when the time came to ask him to\nresign from the Apple board, Jobs drove to Markkula’s chateau-like mansion in the\nWoodside hills to do it personally. As usual, he asked to take a walk, and they strolled\nthe grounds to a redwood grove with a picnic table. “He told me he wanted a new\nboard because he wanted to start fresh,” Markkula said. “He was worried that I might\ntake it poorly, and he was relieved when I didn’t.”\nThey spent the rest of the time talking about where Apple should focus in the future.\nJobs’s ambition was to build a company that would endure, and he asked Markkula\nwhat the formula for that would be. Markkula replied that lasting companies know how\nto  reinvent  themselves.  Hewlett-Packard  had  done  that  repeatedly;  it  started  as  an\ninstrument  company,  then  became  a  calculator  company,  then  a  computer  company.\n“Apple has been sidelined by Microsoft in the PC business,” Markkula said. “You’ve\ngot to reinvent the company to do some other thing, like other consumer products or\ndevices. You’ve got to be like a butterfly and have a metamorphosis.” Jobs didn’t say\nmuch, but he agreed.\nThe old board met in late July to ratify the transition. Woolard, who was as genteel\nas Jobs was prickly, was mildly taken aback when Jobs appeared dressed in jeans and\nsneakers, and he worried that Jobs might start berating the veteran board members for\nscrewing up. But Jobs merely offered a pleasant “Hi, everyone.” They got down to the\nbusiness of voting to accept the resignations, elect Jobs to the board, and empower\nWoolard and Jobs to find new board members.\nJobs’s first recruit was, not surprisingly, Larry Ellison. He said he would be pleased\nto join, but he hated attending meetings. Jobs said it would be fine if he came to only\nhalf of them. (After a while Ellison was coming to only a third of the meetings. Jobs\ntook a picture of him that had appeared on the cover of Business Week and had it blown\nup to life size and pasted on a cardboard cutout to put in his chair.)\n\nJobs also brought in Bill Campbell, who had run marketing at Apple in the early\n1980s and been caught in the middle of the Sculley-Jobs clash. Campbell had ended up\nsticking with Sculley, but he had grown to dislike him so much that Jobs forgave him.\nNow he was the CEO of Intuit and a walking buddy of Jobs. “We were sitting out in the\nback of his house,” recalled Campbell, who lived only five blocks from Jobs in Palo\nAlto, “and he said he was going back to Apple and wanted me on the board. I said,\n‘Holy shit, of course I will do that.’” Campbell had been a football coach at Columbia,\nand his great talent, Jobs said, was to “get A performances out of B players.” At Apple,\nJobs told him, he would get to work with A players.\nWoolard helped bring in Jerry York, who had been the chief financial officer at\nChrysler and then IBM. Others were considered and then rejected by Jobs, including\nMeg Whitman, who was then the manager of Hasbro’s Playskool division and had been\na strategic planner at Disney. (In 1998 she became CEO of eBay, and she later ran\nunsuccessfully for governor of California.) Over the years Jobs would bring in some\nstrong leaders to serve on the Apple board, including Al Gore, Eric Schmidt of Google,\nArt Levinson of Genentech, Mickey Drexler of the Gap and J. Crew, and Andrea Jung of\nAvon. But he always made sure they were loyal, sometimes loyal to a fault. Despite\ntheir stature, they seemed at times awed or intimidated by Jobs, and they were eager to\nkeep him happy.\nAt one point he invited Arthur Levitt, the former SEC chairman, to become a board\nmember. Levitt, who bought his first Macintosh in 1984 and was proudly “addicted” to\nApple computers, was thrilled. He was excited to visit Cupertino, where he discussed\nthe  role  with  Jobs.  But  then  Jobs  read  a  speech  Levitt  had  given  about  corporate\ngovernance, which argued that boards should play a strong and independent role, and he\ntelephoned to withdraw the invitation. “Arthur, I don’t think you’d be happy on our\nboard, and I think it best if we not invite you,” Levitt said Jobs told him. “Frankly, I\nthink some of the issues you raised, while appropriate for some companies, really don’t\napply to Apple’s culture.” Levitt later wrote, “I was floored. ... It’s plain to me that\nApple’s board is not designed to act independently of the CEO.”\nMacworld Boston, August 1997\nThe staff memo announcing the repricing of Apple’s stock options was signed “Steve\nand the executive team,” and it soon became public that he was running all of the\ncompany’s product review meetings. These and other indications that Jobs was now\ndeeply engaged at Apple helped push the stock up from about $13 to $20 during July. It\nalso created a frisson of excitement as the Apple faithful gathered for the August 1997\nMacworld in Boston. More than five thousand showed up hours in advance to cram into\nthe Castle convention hall of the Park Plaza hotel for Jobs’s keynote speech. They came\n\nto see their returning hero—and to find out whether he was really ready to lead them\nagain.\nHuge cheers erupted when a picture of Jobs from 1984 was flashed on the overhead\nscreen. “Steve! Steve! Steve!” the crowd started to chant, even as he was still being\nintroduced. When he finally strode onstage—wearing a black vest, collarless white\nshirt, jeans, and an impish smile—the screams and flashbulbs rivaled those for any rock\nstar. At first he punctured the excitement by reminding them of where he officially\nworked. “I’m Steve Jobs, the chairman and CEO of Pixar,” he introduced himself,\nflashing a slide onscreen with that title. Then he explained his role at Apple. “I, like a\nlot of other people, are pulling together to help Apple get healthy again.”\nBut as Jobs paced back and forth across the stage, changing the overhead slides with\na clicker in his hand, it was clear that he was now in charge at Apple—and was likely\nto remain so. He delivered a carefully crafted presentation, using no notes, on why\nApple’s sales had fallen by 30% over the previous two years. “There are a lot of great\npeople at Apple, but they’re doing the wrong things because the plan has been wrong,”\nhe said. “I’ve found people who can’t wait to fall into line behind a good strategy, but\nthere just hasn’t been one.” The crowd again erupted in yelps, whistles, and cheers.\nAs he spoke, his passion poured forth with increasing intensity, and he began saying\n“we” and “I”—rather than “they”—when referring to what Apple would be doing. “I\nthink you still have to think differently to buy an Apple computer,” he said. “The people\nwho buy them do think different. They are the creative spirits in this world, and they’re\nout to change the world. We make tools for those kinds of people.” When he stressed the\nword “we” in that sentence, he cupped his hands and tapped his fingers on his chest.\nAnd then, in his final peroration, he continued to stress the word “we” as he talked\nabout Apple’s future. “We too are going to think differently and serve the people who\nhave been buying our products from the beginning. Because a lot of people think they’re\ncrazy, but in that craziness we see genius.” During the prolonged standing ovation,\npeople looked at each other in awe, and a few wiped tears from their eyes. Jobs had\nmade it very clear that he and the “we” of Apple were one.\nThe Microsoft Pact\nThe  climax  of  Jobs’s  August  1997  Macworld  appearance  was  a  bombshell\nannouncement, one that made the cover of both Time and Newsweek. Near the end of his\nspeech, he paused for a sip of water and began to talk in more subdued tones. “Apple\nlives in an ecosystem,” he said. “It needs help from other partners. Relationships that\nare destructive don’t help anybody in this industry.” For dramatic effect, he paused\nagain, and then explained: “I’d like to announce one of our first new partnerships today,\n\na very meaningful one, and that is one with Microsoft.” The Microsoft and Apple logos\nappeared together on the screen as people gasped.\nApple and Microsoft had been at war for a decade over a variety of copyright and\npatent issues, most notably whether Microsoft had stolen the look and feel of Apple’s\ngraphical user interface. Just as Jobs was being eased out of Apple in 1985, John\nSculley  had  struck  a  surrender  deal:  Microsoft  could  license  the  Apple  GUI  for\nWindows 1.0, and in return it would make Excel exclusive to the Mac for up to two\nyears.  In  1988,  after  Microsoft  came  out  with  Windows  2.0,  Apple  sued.  Sculley\ncontended that the 1985 deal did not apply to Windows 2.0 and that further refinements\nto Windows (such as copying Bill Atkinson’s trick of “clipping” overlapping windows)\nhad made the infringement more blatant. By 1997 Apple had lost the case and various\nappeals, but remnants of the litigation and threats of new suits lingered. In addition,\nPresident Clinton’s Justice Department was preparing a massive antitrust case against\nMicrosoft. Jobs invited the lead prosecutor, Joel Klein, to Palo Alto. Don’t worry about\nextracting a huge remedy against Microsoft, Jobs told him over coffee. Instead simply\nkeep them tied up in litigation. That would allow Apple the opportunity, Jobs explained,\nto “make an end run” around Microsoft and start offering competing products.\nUnder Amelio, the showdown had become explosive. Microsoft refused to commit\nto developing Word and Excel for future Macintosh operating systems, which could\nhave destroyed Apple. In defense of Bill Gates, he was not simply being vindictive. It\nwas  understandable  that  he  was  reluctant  to  commit  to  developing  for  a  future\nMacintosh operating system when no one, including the ever-changing leadership at\nApple, seemed to know what that new operating system would be. Right after Apple\nbought NeXT, Amelio and Jobs flew together to visit Microsoft, but Gates had trouble\nfiguring out which of them was in charge. A few days later he called Jobs privately.\n“Hey, what the fuck, am I supposed to put my applications on the NeXT OS?” Gates\nasked. Jobs responded by “making smart-ass remarks about Gil,” Gates recalled, and\nsuggesting that the situation would soon be clarified.\nWhen the leadership issue was partly resolved by Amelio’s ouster, one of Jobs’s\nfirst phone calls was to Gates. Jobs recalled:\nI called up Bill and said, “I’m going to turn this thing around.” Bill always had a soft\nspot for Apple. We got him into the application software business. The first Microsoft\napps were Excel and Word for the Mac. So I called him and said, “I need help.”\nMicrosoft was walking over Apple’s patents. I said, “If we kept up our lawsuits, a few\nyears from now we could win a billion-dollar patent suit. You know it, and I know it.\nBut Apple’s not going to survive that long if we’re at war. I know that. So let’s figure\nout how to settle this right away. All I need is a commitment that Microsoft will keep\ndeveloping for the Mac and an investment by Microsoft in Apple so it has a stake in our\nsuccess.”\n\nWhen I recounted to him what Jobs said, Gates agreed it was accurate. “We had a group\nof people who liked working on the Mac stuff, and we liked the Mac,” Gates recalled.\nHe had been negotiating with Amelio for six months, and the proposals kept getting\nlonger and more complicated. “So Steve comes in and says, ‘Hey, that deal is too\ncomplicated.  What  I  want  is  a  simple  deal.  I  want  the  commitment  and  I  want  an\ninvestment.’ And so we put that together in just four weeks.”\nGates and his chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, made the trip to Palo Alto to work\nout the framework for a deal, and then Maffei returned alone the following Sunday to\nwork on the details. When he arrived at Jobs’s home, Jobs grabbed two bottles of water\nout of the refrigerator and took Maffei for a walk around the Palo Alto neighborhood.\nBoth men wore shorts, and Jobs walked barefoot. As they sat in front of a Baptist\nchurch, Jobs cut to the core issues. “These are the things we care about,” he said. “A\ncommitment to make software for the Mac and an investment.”\nAlthough the negotiations went quickly, the final details were not finished until hours\nbefore Jobs’s Macworld speech in Boston. He was rehearsing at the Park Plaza Castle\nwhen his cell phone rang. “Hi, Bill,” he said as his words echoed through the old hall.\nThen he walked to a corner and spoke in a soft tone so others couldn’t hear. The call\nlasted an hour. Finally, the remaining deal points were resolved. “Bill, thank you for\nyour support of this company,” Jobs said as he crouched on the empty stage. “I think the\nworld’s a better place for it.”\nDuring  his  Macworld  keynote address,  Jobs  walked  through  the  details  of  the\nMicrosoft deal. At first there were groans and hisses from the faithful. Particularly\ngalling was Jobs’s announcement that, as part of the peace pact, “Apple has decided to\nmake Internet Explorer its default browser on the Macintosh.” The audience erupted in\nboos, and Jobs quickly added, “Since we believe in choice, we’re going to be shipping\nother Internet browsers, as well, and the user can, of course, change their default should\nthey choose to.” There were some laughs and scattered applause. The audience was\nbeginning  to  come  around,  especially  when  he  announced  that  Microsoft  would  be\ninvesting $150 million in Apple and getting nonvoting shares.\nBut the mellower mood was shattered for a moment when Jobs made one of the few\nvisual and public relations gaffes of his onstage career. “I happen to have a special\nguest with me today via satellite downlink,” he said, and suddenly Bill Gates’s face\nappeared on the huge screen looming over Jobs and the auditorium. There was a thin\nsmile on Gates’s face that flirted with being a smirk. The audience gasped in horror,\nfollowed by some boos and catcalls. The scene was such a brutal echo of the 1984 Big\nBrother ad that you half expected (and hoped?) that an athletic woman would suddenly\ncome running down the aisle and vaporize the screenshot with a well-thrown hammer.\nBut it was all for real, and Gates, unaware of the jeering, began speaking on the\nsatellite link from Microsoft headquarters. “Some of the most exciting work that I’ve\ndone in my career has been the work that I’ve done with Steve on the Macintosh,” he\nintoned in his high-pitched singsong. As he went on to tout the new version of Microsoft\n\nOffice that was being made for the Macintosh, the audience quieted down and then\nslowly seemed to accept the new world order. Gates even was able to rouse some\napplause when he said that the new Mac versions of Word and Excel would be “in many\nways more advanced than what we’ve done on the Windows platform.”\nJobs realized that the image of Gates looming over him and the audience was a\nmistake. “I wanted him to come to Boston,” Jobs later said. “That was my worst and\nstupidest staging event ever. It was bad because it made me look small, and Apple look\nsmall, and as if everything was in Bill’s hands.” Gates likewise was embarrassed when\nhe saw the videotape of the event. “I didn’t know that my face was going to be blown up\nto looming proportions,” he said.\nJobs tried to reassure the audience with an impromptu sermon. “If we want to move\nforward and see Apple healthy again, we have to let go of a few things here,” he told\nthe audience. “We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win Microsoft has to\nlose. ... I think if we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company\nthat puts it out with a little bit of gratitude.”\nThe Microsoft announcement, along with Jobs’s passionate reengagement with the\ncompany, provided a much-needed jolt for Apple. By the end of the day, its stock had\nskyrocketed $6.56, or 33%, to close at $26.31, twice the price of the day Amelio\nresigned. The one-day jump added $830 million to Apple’s stock market capitalization.\nThe company was back from the edge of the grave.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nTHINK DIFFERENT\nJobs as iCEO\nEnlisting Picasso\nHere’s to the Crazy Ones\nLee Clow, the creative director at Chiat/Day who had done the great “1984” ad for the\nlaunch of the Macintosh, was driving in Los Angeles in early July 1997 when his car\nphone rang. It was Jobs. “Hi, Lee, this is Steve,” he said. “Guess what? Amelio just\nresigned. Can you come up here?”\n\nApple  was  going  through  a  review  to  select  a  new  agency,  and  Jobs  was  not\nimpressed  by  what  he  had  seen.  So  he  wanted  Clow  and  his  firm,  by  then  called\nTBWA\\Chiat\\Day, to compete for the business. “We have to prove that Apple is still\nalive,” Jobs said, “and that it still stands for something special.”\nClow said that he didn’t pitch for accounts. “You know our work,” he said. But Jobs\nbegged him. It would be hard to reject all the others that were making pitches, including\nBBDO and Arnold Worldwide, and bring back “an old crony,” as Jobs put it. Clow\nagreed to fly up to Cupertino with something they could show. Recounting the scene\nyears later, Jobs started to cry.\nThis chokes me up, this really chokes me up. It was so clear that Lee loved Apple so\nmuch. Here was the best guy in advertising. And he hadn’t pitched in ten years. Yet here\nhe was, and he was pitching his heart out, because he loved Apple as much as we did.\nHe and his team had come up with this brilliant idea, “Think Different.” And it was ten\ntimes better than anything the other agencies showed. It choked me up, and it still makes\nme cry to think about it, both the fact that Lee cared so much and also how brilliant his\n“Think Different” idea was. Every once in a while, I find myself in the presence of\npurity—purity of spirit and love—and I always cry. It always just reaches in and grabs\nme. That was one of those moments. There was a purity about that I will never forget. I\ncried in my office as he was showing me the idea, and I still cry when I think about it.\nJobs and Clow agreed that Apple was one of the great brands of the world, probably\nin the top five based on emotional appeal, but they needed to remind folks what was\ndistinctive about it. So they wanted a brand image campaign, not a set of advertisements\nfeaturing products. It was designed to celebrate not what the computers could do, but\nwhat creative people could do with the computers. “This wasn’t about processor speed\nor  memory,”  Jobs  recalled.  “It  was  about  creativity.”  It  was  directed  not  only  at\npotential customers, but also at Apple’s own employees: “We at Apple had forgotten\nwho we were. One way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are.\nThat was the genesis of that campaign.”\nClow and his team tried a variety of approaches that praised the “crazy ones” who\n“think different.” They did one video with the Seal song “Crazy” (“We’re never gonna\nsurvive unless we get a little crazy”), but couldn’t get the rights to it. Then they tried\nversions using a recording of Robert Frost reading “The Road Not Taken” and of Robin\nWilliams’s speeches from Dead Poets Society. Eventually they decided they needed to\nwrite their own text; their draft began, “Here’s to the crazy ones.”\nJobs was as demanding as ever. When Clow’s team flew up with a version of the\ntext, he exploded at the young copywriter. “This is shit!” he yelled. “It’s advertising\nagency shit and I hate it.” It was the first time the young copywriter had met Jobs, and he\n\nstood there mute. He never went back. But those who could stand up to Jobs, including\nClow and his teammates Ken Segall and Craig Tanimoto, were able to work with him to\ncreate a tone poem that he liked. In its original sixty-second version it read:\nHere’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in\nthe square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And\nthey have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify\nor vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change\nthings. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy\nones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change\nthe world are the ones who do.\nJobs, who could identify with each of those sentiments, wrote some of the lines\nhimself, including “They push the human race forward.” By the time of the Boston\nMacworld in early August, they had produced a rough version. They agreed it was not\nready, but Jobs used the concepts, and the “think different” phrase, in his keynote speech\nthere. “There’s a germ of a brilliant idea there,” he said at the time. “Apple is about\npeople who think outside the box, who want to use computers to help them change the\nworld.”\nThey debated the grammatical issue: If “different” was supposed to modify the verb\n“think,” it should be an adverb, as in “think differently.” But Jobs insisted that he\nwanted “different” to be used as a noun, as in “think victory” or “think beauty.” Also, it\nechoed colloquial use, as in “think big.” Jobs later explained, “We discussed whether it\nwas correct before we ran it. It’s grammatical, if you think about what we’re trying to\nsay. It’s not think the  same,  it’s  think different. Think a little different, think a lot\ndifferent, think different. ‘Think differently’ wouldn’t hit the meaning for me.”\nIn order to evoke the spirit of Dead  Poets  Society, Clow and Jobs wanted to get\nRobin Williams to read the narration. His agent said that Williams didn’t do ads, so\nJobs tried to call him directly. He got through to Williams’s wife, who would not let\nhim  talk  to  the  actor  because  she  knew  how  persuasive  he  could  be.  They  also\nconsidered  Maya  Angelou  and  Tom  Hanks.  At  a  fund-raising  dinner  featuring  Bill\nClinton that fall, Jobs pulled the president aside and asked him to telephone Hanks to\ntalk him into it, but the president pocket-vetoed the request. They ended up with Richard\nDreyfuss, who was a dedicated Apple fan.\nIn addition to the television commercials, they created one of the most memorable\nprint campaigns in history. Each ad featured a black-and-white portrait of an iconic\nhistorical figure with just the Apple logo and the words “Think Different” in the corner.\nMaking it particularly engaging was that the faces were not captioned. Some of them—\nEinstein,  Gandhi,  Lennon,  Dylan,  Picasso,  Edison,  Chaplin,  King—were  easy  to\n\nidentify. But others caused people to pause, puzzle, and maybe ask a friend to put a\nname to the face: Martha Graham, Ansel Adams, Richard Feynman, Maria Callas, Frank\nLloyd Wright, James Watson, Amelia Earhart.\nMost were Jobs’s personal heroes. They tended to be creative people who had taken\nrisks,  defied  failure,  and  bet  their  career  on  doing  things  in  a  different  way.  A\nphotography  buff,  he  became  involved  in  making  sure  they  had  the  perfect  iconic\nportraits. “This is not the right picture of Gandhi,” he erupted to Clow at one point.\nClow explained that the famous Margaret Bourke-White photograph of Gandhi at the\nspinning wheel was owned by Time-Life Pictures and was not available for commercial\nuse. So Jobs called Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., and badgered\nhim into making an exception. He called Eunice Shriver to convince her family to\nrelease a picture that he loved, of her brother Bobby Kennedy touring Appalachia, and\nhe talked to Jim Henson’s children personally to get the right shot of the late Muppeteer.\nHe likewise called Yoko Ono for a picture of her late husband, John Lennon. She\nsent him one, but it was not Jobs’s favorite. “Before it ran, I was in New York, and I\nwent to this small Japanese restaurant that I love, and let her know I would be there,” he\nrecalled. When he arrived, she came over to his table. “This is a better one,” she said,\nhanding him an envelope. “I thought I would see you, so I had this with me.” It was the\nclassic photo of her and John in bed together, holding flowers, and it was the one that\nApple ended up using. “I can see why John fell in love with her,” Jobs recalled.\nThe narration by Richard Dreyfuss worked well, but Lee Clow had another idea.\nWhat if Jobs did the voice-over himself? “You really believe this,” Clow told him.\n“You should do it.” So Jobs sat in a studio, did a few takes, and soon produced a voice\ntrack that everyone liked. The idea was that, if they used it, they would not tell people\nwho was speaking the words, just as they didn’t caption the iconic pictures. Eventually\npeople would figure out it was Jobs. “This will be really powerful to have it in your\nvoice,” Clow argued. “It will be a way to reclaim the brand.”\nJobs couldn’t decide whether to use the version with his voice or to stick with\nDreyfuss. Finally, the night came when they had to ship the ad; it was due to air,\nappropriately enough, on the television premiere of Toy Story. As was often the case,\nJobs did not like to be forced to make a decision. He told Clow to ship both versions;\nthis would give him until the morning to decide. When morning came, Jobs called and\ntold them to use the Dreyfuss version. “If we use my voice, when people find out they\nwill say it’s about me,” he told Clow. “It’s not. It’s about Apple.”\nEver since he left the apple commune, Jobs had defined himself, and by extension\nApple, as a child of the counterculture. In ads such as “Think Different” and “1984,” he\npositioned the Apple brand so that it reaffirmed his own rebel streak, even after he\nbecame a billionaire, and it allowed other baby boomers and their kids to do the same.\n“From when I first met him as a young guy, he’s had the greatest intuition of the impact\nhe wants his brand to have on people,” said Clow.\n\nVery few other companies or corporate leaders—perhaps none could have gotten\naway  with  the  brilliant  audacity  of  associating  their  brand  with  Gandhi,  Einstein,\nPicasso, and the Dalai Lama. Jobs was able to encourage people to define themselves\nas anticorporate, creative, innovative rebels simply by the computer they used. “Steve\ncreated the only lifestyle brand in the tech industry,” Larry Ellison said. “There are cars\npeople  are  proud  to  have—Porsche,  Ferrari,  Prius—because  what  I  drive  says\nsomething about me. People feel the same way about an Apple product.”\nStarting with the “Think Different” campaign, and continuing through the rest of his\nyears  at  Apple,  Jobs  held  a  freewheeling  three-hour  meeting  every  Wednesday\nafternoon with his top agency, marketing, and communications people to kick around\nmessaging strategy. “There’s not a CEO on the planet who deals with marketing the way\nSteve does,” said Clow. “Every Wednesday he approves each new commercial, print\nad, and billboard.” At the end of the meeting, he would often take Clow and his two\nagency  colleagues,  Duncan  Milner  and  James  Vincent,  to  Apple’s  closely  guarded\ndesign studio to see what products were in the works. “He gets very passionate and\nemotional when he shows us what’s in development,” said Vincent. By sharing with his\nmarketing gurus his passion for the products as they were being created, he was able to\nensure that almost every ad they produced was infused with his emotion.\niCEO\nAs he was finishing work on the “Think Different” ad, Jobs did some different thinking\nof his own. He decided that he would officially take over running the company, at least\non a temporary basis. He had been the de facto leader since Amelio’s ouster ten weeks\nearlier, but only as an advisor. Fred Anderson had the titular role of interim CEO. On\nSeptember 16, 1997, Jobs announced that he would take over that title, which inevitably\ngot abbreviated as iCEO. His commitment was tentative: He took no salary and signed\nno contract. But he was not tentative in his actions. He was in charge, and he did not\nrule by consensus.\nThat week he gathered his top managers and staff in the Apple auditorium for a rally,\nfollowed by a picnic featuring beer and vegan food, to celebrate his new role and the\ncompany’s new ads. He was wearing shorts, walking around the campus barefoot, and\nhad a stubble of beard. “I’ve been back about ten weeks, working really hard,” he said,\nlooking tired but deeply determined. “What we’re trying to do is not highfalutin. We’re\ntrying to get back to the basics of great products, great marketing, and great distribution.\nApple has drifted away from doing the basics really well.”\nFor a few more weeks Jobs and the board kept looking for a permanent CEO.\nVarious names surfaced—George M. C. Fisher of Kodak, Sam Palmisano at IBM, Ed\nZander at Sun Microsystems—but most of the candidates were understandably reluctant\n\nto consider becoming CEO if Jobs was going to remain an active board member. The\nSan  Francisco  Chronicle reported that Zander declined to be considered because he\n“didn’t want Steve looking over his shoulder, second-guessing him on every decision.”\nAt one point Jobs and Ellison pulled a prank on a clueless computer consultant who\nwas campaigning for the job; they sent him an email saying that he had been selected,\nwhich caused both amusement and embarrassment when stories appeared in the papers\nthat they were just toying with him.\nBy December it had become clear that Jobs’s iCEO status had evolved from interim\nto indefinite. As Jobs continued to run the company, the board quietly deactivated its\nsearch. “I went back to Apple and tried to hire a CEO, with the help of a recruiting\nagency, for almost four months,” he recalled. “But they didn’t produce the right people.\nThat’s why I finally stayed. Apple was in no shape to attract anybody good.”\nThe problem Jobs faced was that running two companies was brutal. Looking back\non it, he traced his health problems back to those days:\nIt was rough, really rough, the worst time in my life. I had a young family. I had Pixar. I\nwould go to work at 7 a.m. and I’d get back at 9 at night, and the kids would be in bed.\nAnd  I  couldn’t  speak,  I  literally  couldn’t,  I  was  so  exhausted.  I  couldn’t  speak  to\nLaurene. All I could do was watch a half hour of TV and vegetate. It got close to killing\nme. I was driving up to Pixar and down to Apple in a black Porsche convertible, and I\nstarted to get kidney stones. I would rush to the hospital and the hospital would give me\na shot of Demerol in the butt and eventually I would pass it.\nDespite the grueling schedule, the more that Jobs immersed himself in Apple, the\nmore he realized that he would not be able to walk away. When Michael Dell was\nasked at a computer trade show in October 1997 what he would do if he were Steve\nJobs and taking over Apple, he replied, “I’d shut it down and give the money back to the\nshareholders.” Jobs fired off an email to Dell. “CEOs are supposed to have class,” it\nsaid. “I can see that isn’t an opinion you hold.” Jobs liked to stoke up rivalries as a way\nto rally his team—he had done so with IBM and Microsoft—and he did so with Dell.\nWhen  he  called  together  his  managers  to  institute  a  build-to-order  system  for\nmanufacturing and distribution, Jobs used as a backdrop a blown-up picture of Michael\nDell with a target on his face. “We’re coming after you, buddy,” he said to cheers from\nhis troops.\nOne of his motivating passions was to build a lasting company. At age twelve, when\nhe got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard, he learned that a properly run company could\nspawn innovation far more than any single creative individual. “I discovered that the\nbest  innovation  is  sometimes  the  company,  the  way  you  organize  a  company,”  he\nrecalled. “The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating. When I got the\n\nchance to come back to Apple, I realized that I would be useless without the company,\nand that’s why I decided to stay and rebuild it.”\nKilling the Clones\nOne of the great debates about Apple was whether it should have licensed its operating\nsystem  more  aggressively  to  other  computer  makers,  the  way  Microsoft  licensed\nWindows. Wozniak had favored that approach from the beginning. “We had the most\nbeautiful operating system,” he said, “but to get it you had to buy our hardware at twice\nthe price. That was a mistake. What we should have done was calculate an appropriate\nprice to license the operating system.” Alan Kay, the star of Xerox PARC who came to\nApple  as  a  fellow  in  1984,  also  fought  hard  for  licensing  the  Mac  OS  software.\n“Software people are always multiplatform, because you want to run on everything,” he\nrecalled. “And that was a huge battle, probably the largest battle I lost at Apple.”\nBill Gates, who was building a fortune by licensing Microsoft’s operating system,\nhad urged Apple to do the same in 1985, just as Jobs was being eased out. Gates\nbelieved  that,  even  if  Apple  took  away  some  of  Microsoft’s  operating  system\ncustomers,  Microsoft  could  make  money  by  creating  versions  of  its  applications\nsoftware, such as Word and Excel, for the users of the Macintosh and its clones. “I was\ntrying to do everything to get them to be a strong licensor,” he recalled. He sent a formal\nmemo to Sculley making the case. “The industry has reached the point where it is now\nimpossible for Apple to create a standard out of their innovative technology without\nsupport from, and the resulting credibility of, other personal computer manufacturers,”\nhe  argued.  “Apple  should  license  Macintosh  technology  to  3–5  significant\nmanufacturers for the development of ‘Mac Compatibles.’” Gates got no reply, so he\nwrote a second memo suggesting some companies that would be good at cloning the\nMac, and he added, “I want to help in any way I can with the licensing. Please give me\na call.”\nApple resisted licensing out the Macintosh operating system until 1994, when CEO\nMichael  Spindler  allowed  two  small  companies,  Power  Computing  and  Radius,  to\nmake Macintosh clones. When Gil Amelio took over in 1996, he added Motorola to the\nlist. It turned out to be a dubious business strategy: Apple got an $80 licensing fee for\neach computer sold, but instead of expanding the market, the cloners cannibalized the\nsales of Apple’s own high-end computers, on which it made up to $500 in profit.\nJobs’s objections to the cloning program were not just economic, however. He had\nan inbred aversion to it. One of his core principles was that hardware and software\nshould be tightly integrated. He loved to control all aspects of his life, and the only way\nto do that with computers was to take responsibility for the user experience from end to\nend.\n\nSo upon his return to Apple he made killing the Macintosh clones a priority. When a\nnew version of the Mac operating system shipped in July 1997, weeks after he had\nhelped oust Amelio, Jobs did not allow the clone makers to upgrade to it. The head of\nPower Computing, Stephen “King” Kahng, organized pro-cloning protests when Jobs\nappeared at Boston Macworld that August and publicly warned that the Macintosh OS\nwould die if Jobs declined to keep licensing it out. “If the platform goes closed, it is\nover,” Kahng said. “Total destruction. Closed is the kiss of death.”\nJobs disagreed. He telephoned Ed Woolard to say he was getting Apple out of the\nlicensing business. The board acquiesced, and in September he reached a deal to pay\nPower Computing $100 million to relinquish its license and give Apple access to its\ndatabase of customers. He soon terminated the licenses of the other cloners as well. “It\nwas the dumbest thing in the world to let companies making crappier hardware use our\noperating system and cut into our sales,” he later said.\nProduct Line Review\nOne of Jobs’s great strengths was knowing how to focus. “Deciding what not to do is as\nimportant as deciding what to do,” he said. “That’s true for companies, and it’s true for\nproducts.”\nHe went to work applying this principle as soon as he returned to Apple. One day he\nwas walking the halls and ran into a young Wharton School graduate who had been\nAmelio’s assistant and who said he was wrapping up his work. “Well, good, because I\nneed someone to do grunt work,” Jobs told him. His new role was to take notes as Jobs\nmet with the dozens of product teams at Apple, asked them to explain what they were\ndoing, and forced them to justify going ahead with their products or projects.\nHe also enlisted a friend, Phil Schiller, who had worked at Apple but was then at the\ngraphics  software  company  Macromedia.  “Steve  would  summon  the  teams  into  the\nboardroom, which seats twenty, and they would come with thirty people and try to show\nPowerPoints, which Steve didn’t want to see,” Schiller recalled. One of the first things\nJobs did during the product review process was ban PowerPoints. “I hate the way\npeople use slide presentations instead of thinking,” Jobs later recalled. “People would\nconfront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things\nout at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they’re\ntalking about don’t need PowerPoint.”\nThe product review revealed how unfocused Apple had become. The company was\nchurning out multiple versions of each product because of bureaucratic momentum and\nto satisfy the whims of retailers. “It was insanity,” Schiller recalled. “Tons of products,\nmost  of  them  crap,  done  by  deluded  teams.”  Apple  had  a  dozen  versions  of  the\nMacintosh, each with a different confusing number, ranging from 1400 to 9600. “I had\n\npeople explaining this to me for three weeks,” Jobs said. “I couldn’t figure it out.” He\nfinally began asking simple questions, like, “Which ones do I tell my friends to buy?”\nWhen  he  couldn’t  get  simple  answers,  he  began  slashing  away  at  models  and\nproducts. Soon he had cut 70% of them. “You are bright people,” he told one group.\n“You shouldn’t be wasting your time on such crappy products.” Many of the engineers\nwere infuriated at his slash-and-burn tactics, which resulted in massive layoffs. But\nJobs later claimed that the good engineers, including some whose projects were killed,\nwere appreciative. He told one staff meeting in September 1997, “I came out of the\nmeeting with people who had just gotten their products canceled and they were three\nfeet off the ground with excitement because they finally understood where in the heck\nwe were going.”\nAfter a few weeks Jobs finally had enough. “Stop!” he shouted at one big product\nstrategy session. “This is crazy.” He grabbed a magic marker, padded to a whiteboard,\nand drew a horizontal and vertical line to make a four-squared chart. “Here’s what we\nneed,” he continued. Atop the two columns he wrote “Consumer” and “Pro”; he labeled\nthe two rows “Desktop” and “Portable.” Their job, he said, was to make four great\nproducts, one for each quadrant. “The room was in dumb silence,” Schiller recalled.\nThere was also a stunned silence when Jobs presented the plan to the September\nmeeting  of  the  Apple  board.  “Gil  had  been  urging  us  to  approve  more  and  more\nproducts every meeting,” Woolard recalled. “He kept saying we need more products.\nSteve came in and said we needed fewer. He drew a matrix with four quadrants and\nsaid that this was where we should focus.” At first the board pushed back. It was a risk,\nJobs was told. “I can make it work,” he replied. The board never voted on the new\nstrategy. Jobs was in charge, and he forged ahead.\nThe result was that the Apple engineers and managers suddenly became sharply\nfocused on just four areas. For the professional desktop quadrant, they would work on\nmaking the Power Macintosh G3. For the professional portable, there would be the\nPowerBook G3. For the consumer desktop, work would begin on what became the\niMac. And for the consumer portable, they would focus on what would become the\niBook. The “i,” Jobs later explained, was to emphasize that the devices would be\nseamlessly integrated with the Internet.\nApple’s sharper focus meant getting the company out of other businesses, such as\nprinters and servers. In 1997 Apple was selling StyleWriter color printers that were\nbasically a version of the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet. HP made most of its money by\nselling the ink cartridges. “I don’t understand,” Jobs said at the product review meeting.\n“You’re going to ship a million and not make money on these? This is nuts.” He left the\nroom and called the head of HP. Let’s tear up our arrangement, Jobs proposed, and we\nwill get out of the printer business and just let you do it. Then he came back to the\nboardroom and announced the decision. “Steve looked at the situation and instantly\nknew we needed to get outside of the box,” Schiller recalled.\n\nThe most visible decision he made was to kill, once and for all, the Newton, the\npersonal digital assistant with the almost-good handwriting-recognition system. Jobs\nhated it because it was Sculley’s pet project, because it didn’t work perfectly, and\nbecause he had an aversion to stylus devices. He had tried to get Amelio to kill it early\nin 1997 and succeeded only in convincing him to try to spin off the division. By late\n1997, when Jobs did his product reviews, it was still around. He later described his\nthinking:\nIf Apple had been in a less precarious situation, I would have drilled down myself to\nfigure out how to make it work. I didn’t trust the people running it. My gut was that there\nwas some really good technology, but it was fucked up by mismanagement. By shutting\nit down, I freed up some good engineers who could work on new mobile devices. And\neventually we got it right when we moved on to iPhones and the iPad.\nThis ability to focus saved Apple. In his first year back, Jobs laid off more than three\nthousand people, which salvaged the company’s balance sheet. For the fiscal year that\nended when Jobs became interim CEO in September 1997, Apple lost $1.04 billion.\n“We were less than ninety days from being insolvent,” he recalled. At the January 1998\nSan Francisco Macworld, Jobs took the stage where Amelio had bombed a year earlier.\nHe sported a full beard and a leather jacket as he touted the new product strategy. And\nfor  the  first  time  he  ended  the  presentation  with  a  phrase  that  he  would  make  his\nsignature coda: “Oh, and one more thing. ...” This time the “one more thing” was\n“Think Profit.” When he said those words, the crowd erupted in applause. After two\nyears of staggering losses, Apple had enjoyed a profitable quarter, making $45 million.\nFor the full fiscal year of 1998, it would turn in a $309 million profit. Jobs was back,\nand so was Apple.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES\nThe Studio of Jobs and Ive\nWith Jony Ive and the sunflower iMac, 2002\nJony Ive\nWhen Jobs gathered his top management for a pep talk just after he became iCEO in\nSeptember 1997, sitting in the audience was a sensitive and passionate thirty-year-old\nBrit who was head of the company’s design team. Jonathan Ive, known to all as Jony,\nwas planning to quit. He was sick of the company’s focus on profit maximization rather\nthan product design. Jobs’s talk led him to reconsider. “I remember very clearly Steve\nannouncing that our goal is not just to make money but to make great products,” Ive\n\nrecalled. “The decisions you make based on that philosophy are fundamentally different\nfrom the ones we had been making at Apple.” Ive and Jobs would soon forge a bond\nthat would lead to the greatest industrial design collaboration of their era.\nIve grew up in Chingford, a town on the northeast edge of London. His father was a\nsilversmith who taught at the local college. “He’s a fantastic craftsman,” Ive recalled.\n“His Christmas gift to me would be one day of his time in his college workshop, during\nthe Christmas break when no one else was there, helping me make whatever I dreamed\nup.” The only condition was that Jony had to draw by hand what they planned to make.\n“I always understood the beauty of things made by hand. I came to realize that what was\nreally important was the care that was put into it. What I really despise is when I sense\nsome carelessness in a product.”\nIve  enrolled  in  Newcastle  Polytechnic  and  spent  his  spare  time  and  summers\nworking at a design consultancy. One of his creations was a pen with a little ball on top\nthat was fun to fiddle with. It helped give the owner a playful emotional connection to\nthe pen. For his thesis he designed a microphone and earpiece—in purest white plastic\n—to communicate with hearing-impaired kids. His flat was filled with foam models he\nhad made to help him perfect the design. He also designed an ATM machine and a\ncurved phone, both of which won awards from the Royal Society of Arts. Unlike some\ndesigners,  he  didn’t  just  make  beautiful  sketches;  he  also  focused  on  how  the\nengineering and inner components would work. He had an epiphany in college when he\nwas able to design on a Macintosh. “I discovered the Mac and felt I had a connection\nwith the people who were making this product,” he recalled. “I suddenly understood\nwhat a company was, or was supposed to be.”\nAfter graduation Ive helped to build a design firm in London, Tangerine, which got a\nconsulting contract with Apple. In 1992 he moved to Cupertino to take a job in the\nApple design department. He became the head of the department in 1996, the year\nbefore  Jobs  returned,  but  wasn’t  happy.  Amelio  had  little  appreciation  for  design.\n“There wasn’t that feeling of putting care into a product, because we were trying to\nmaximize the money we made,” Ive said. “All they wanted from us designers was a\nmodel of what something was supposed to look like on the outside, and then engineers\nwould make it as cheap as possible. I was about to quit.”\nWhen Jobs took over and gave his pep talk, Ive decided to stick around. But Jobs at\nfirst looked around for a world-class designer from the outside. He talked to Richard\nSapper, who designed the IBM ThinkPad, and Giorgetto Giugiaro, who designed the\nFerrari 250 and the Maserati Ghibli. But then he took a tour of Apple’s design studio\nand bonded with the affable, eager, and very earnest Ive. “We discussed approaches to\nforms  and  materials,”  Ive  recalled.  “We  were  on  the  same  wavelength.  I  suddenly\nunderstood why I loved the company.”\nIve reported, at least initially, to Jon Rubinstein, whom Jobs had brought in to head\nthe hardware division, but he developed a direct and unusually strong relationship with\nJobs. They began to have lunch together regularly, and Jobs would end his day by\n\ndropping by Ive’s design studio for a chat. “Jony had a special status,” said Laurene\nPowell. “He would come by our house, and our families became close. Steve is never\nintentionally wounding to him. Most people in Steve’s life are replaceable. But not\nJony.”\nJobs described to me his respect for Ive:\nThe difference that Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the world, is huge. He is a\nwickedly intelligent person in all ways. He understands business concepts, marketing\nconcepts. He picks stuff up just like that, click. He understands what we do at our core\nbetter than anyone. If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony. Jony and I think up\nmost of the products together and then pull others in and say, “Hey, what do you think\nabout this?” He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each\nproduct. And he understands that Apple is a product company. He’s not just a designer.\nThat’s why he works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else\nat Apple except me. There’s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That’s\nthe way I set it up.\nLike  most  designers,  Ive  enjoyed  analyzing  the  philosophy  and  the  step-by-step\nthinking that went into a particular design. For Jobs, the process was more intuitive. He\nwould point to models and sketches he liked and dump on the ones he didn’t. Ive would\nthen take the cues and develop the concepts Jobs blessed.\nIve was a fan of the German industrial designer Dieter Rams, who worked for the\nelectronics firm Braun. Rams preached the gospel of “Less but better,” Weniger  aber\nbesser, and likewise Jobs and Ive wrestled with each new design to see how much they\ncould  simplify  it.  Ever  since  Apple’s  first  brochure  proclaimed  “Simplicity  is  the\nultimate sophistication,” Jobs had aimed for the simplicity that comes from conquering\ncomplexities,  not  ignoring  them.  “It  takes  a  lot  of  hard  work,”  he  said,  “to  make\nsomething  simple,  to  truly  understand  the  underlying  challenges  and  come  up  with\nelegant solutions.”\nIn Ive, Jobs met his soul mate in the quest for true rather than surface simplicity.\nSitting in his design studio, Ive described his philosophy:\nWhy do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products, we have to\nfeel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make\nthe product defer to you. Simplicity isn’t just a visual style. It’s not just minimalism or\nthe absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be\ntruly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something,\nyou can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is\n\nto  go  deeper  with  the  simplicity,  to  understand  everything  about  it  and  how  it’s\nmanufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be\nable to get rid of the parts that are not essential.\nThat was the fundamental principle Jobs and Ive shared. Design was not just about what\na product looked like on the surface. It had to reflect the product’s essence. “In most\npeople’s vocabularies, design means veneer,” Jobs told Fortune shortly after retaking\nthe reins at Apple. “But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.\nDesign is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in\nsuccessive outer layers.”\nAs a result, the process of designing a product at Apple was integrally related to\nhow it would be engineered and manufactured. Ive described one of Apple’s Power\nMacs. “We wanted to get rid of anything other than what was absolutely essential,” he\nsaid.  “To  do  so  required  total  collaboration  between  the  designers,  the  product\ndevelopers,  the  engineers,  and  the  manufacturing  team.  We  kept  going  back  to  the\nbeginning, again and again. Do we need that part? Can we get it to perform the function\nof the other four parts?”\nThe connection between the design of a product, its essence, and its manufacturing\nwas illustrated for Jobs and Ive when they were traveling in France and went into a\nkitchen  supply  store.  Ive  picked  up  a  knife  he  admired,  but  then  put  it  down  in\ndisappointment. Jobs did the same.\n“We both noticed a tiny bit of glue between the handle and the blade,” Ive recalled.\nThey talked about how the knife’s good design had been ruined by the way it was\nmanufactured. “We don’t like to think of our knives as being glued together,” Ive said.\n“Steve and I care about things like that, which ruin the purity and detract from the\nessence of something like a utensil, and we think alike about how products should be\nmade to look pure and seamless.”\nAt most other companies, engineering tends to drive design. The engineers set forth\ntheir specifications and requirements, and the designers then come up with cases and\nshells that will accommodate them. For Jobs, the process tended to work the other way.\nIn the early days of Apple, Jobs had approved the design of the case of the original\nMacintosh, and the engineers had to make their boards and components fit.\nAfter he was forced out, the process at Apple reverted to being engineer-driven.\n“Before Steve came back, engineers would say ‘Here are the guts’—processor, hard\ndrive—and then it would go to the designers to put it in a box,” said Apple’s marketing\nchief Phil Schiller. “When you do it that way, you come up with awful products.” But\nwhen Jobs returned and forged his bond with Ive, the balance was again tilted toward\nthe designers. “Steve kept impressing on us that the design was integral to what would\nmake us great,” said Schiller. “Design once again dictated the engineering, not just vice\nversa.”\n\nOn occasion this could backfire, such as when Jobs and Ive insisted on using a solid\npiece of stainless steel for the edge of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried\nthat it would compromise reception. But usually the distinctiveness of its designs—for\nthe iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad—would set Apple apart and lead to its\ntriumphs in the years after Jobs returned.\nInside the Studio\nThe design studio where Jony Ive reigns, on the ground floor of Two Infinite Loop on\nthe Apple campus, is shielded by tinted windows and a heavy clad, locked door. Just\ninside is a glass-booth reception desk where two assistants guard access. Even high-\nlevel Apple employees are not allowed in without special permission. Most of my\ninterviews with Jony Ive for this book were held elsewhere, but one day in 2010 he\narranged for me to spend an afternoon touring the studio and talking about how he and\nJobs collaborate there.\nTo the left of the entrance is a bullpen of desks with young designers; to the right is\nthe cavernous main room with six long steel tables for displaying and playing with\nworks in progress. Beyond the main room is a computer-aided design studio, filled with\nworkstations, that leads to a room with molding machines to turn what’s on the screens\ninto foam models. Beyond that is a robot-controlled spray-painting chamber to make the\nmodels look real. The look is sparse and industrial, with metallic gray décor. Leaves\nfrom the trees outside cast moving patterns of light and shadows on the tinted windows.\nTechno and jazz play in the background.\nAlmost every day when Jobs was healthy and in the office, he would have lunch with\nIve and then wander by the studio in the afternoon. As he entered, he could survey the\ntables and see the products in the pipeline, sense how they fit into Apple’s strategy, and\ninspect with his fingertips the evolving design of each. Usually it was just the two of\nthem alone, while the other designers glanced up from their work but kept a respectful\ndistance. If Jobs had a specific issue, he might call over the head of mechanical design\nor another of Ive’s deputies. If something excited him or sparked some thoughts about\ncorporate strategy, he might ask the chief operating officer Tim Cook or the marketing\nhead Phil Schiller to come over and join them. Ive described the usual process:\nThis great room is the one place in the company where you can look around and see\neverything we have in the works. When Steve comes in, he will sit at one of these\ntables. If we’re working on a new iPhone, for example, he might grab a stool and start\nplaying with different models and feeling them in his hands, remarking on which ones he\nlikes best. Then he will graze by the other tables, just him and me, to see where all the\n\nother products are heading. He can get a sense of the sweep of the whole company, the\niPhone and iPad, the iMac and laptop and everything we’re considering. That helps him\nsee where the company is spending its energy and how things connect. And he can ask,\n“Does doing this make sense, because over here is where we are growing a lot?” or\nquestions like that. He gets to see things in relationship to each other, which is pretty\nhard to do in a big company. Looking at the models on these tables, he can see the future\nfor the next three years.\nMuch of the design process is a conversation, a back-and-forth as we walk around\nthe tables and play with the models. He doesn’t like to read complex drawings. He\nwants to see and feel a model. He’s right. I get surprised when we make a model and\nthen  realize  it’s  rubbish,  even  though  based  on  the  CAD  [computer-aided  design]\nrenderings it looked great.\nHe loves coming in here because it’s calm and gentle. It’s a paradise if you’re a\nvisual person. There are no formal design reviews, so there are no huge decision points.\nInstead, we can make the decisions fluid. Since we iterate every day and never have\ndumb-ass presentations, we don’t run into major disagreements.\nOn this day Ive was overseeing the creation of a new European power plug and\nconnector for the Macintosh. Dozens of foam models, each with the tiniest variation,\nhave been cast and painted for inspection. Some would find it odd that the head of\ndesign would fret over something like this, but Jobs got involved as well. Ever since he\nhad a special power supply made for the Apple II, Jobs has cared about not only the\nengineering but also the design of such parts. His name is listed on the patent for the\nwhite power brick used by the MacBook as well as its magnetic connector with its\nsatisfying click. In fact he is listed as one of the inventors for 212 different Apple\npatents in the United States as of the beginning of 2011.\nIve and Jobs have even obsessed over, and patented, the packaging for various\nApple products. U.S. patent D558572, for example, granted on January 1, 2008, is for\nthe iPod Nano box, with four drawings showing how the device is nestled in a cradle\nwhen the box is opened. Patent D596485, issued on July 21, 2009, is for the iPhone\npackaging, with its sturdy lid and little glossy plastic tray inside.\nEarly on, Mike Markkula had taught Jobs to “impute”—to understand that people do\njudge a book by its cover—and therefore to make sure all the trappings and packaging\nof Apple signaled that there was a beautiful gem inside. Whether it’s an iPod Mini or a\nMacBook Pro, Apple customers know the feeling of opening up the well-crafted box\nand finding the product nestled in an inviting fashion. “Steve and I spend a lot of time on\nthe packaging,” said Ive. “I love the process of unpacking something. You design a ritual\nof unpacking to make the product feel special. Packaging can be theater, it can create a\nstory.”\n\nIve, who has the sensitive temperament of an artist, at times got upset with Jobs for\ntaking too much credit, a habit that has bothered other colleagues over the years. His\npersonal feelings for Jobs were so intense that at times he got easily bruised. “He will\ngo through a process of looking at my ideas and say, ‘That’s no good. That’s not very\ngood. I like that one,’” Ive said. “And later I will be sitting in the audience and he will\nbe talking about it as if it was his idea. I pay maniacal attention to where an idea comes\nfrom, and I even keep notebooks filled with my ideas. So it hurts when he takes credit\nfor one of my designs.” Ive also has bristled when outsiders portrayed Jobs as the only\nideas guy at Apple. “That makes us vulnerable as a company,” Ive said earnestly, his\nvoice soft. But then he paused to recognize the role Jobs in fact played. “In so many\nother companies, ideas and great design get lost in the process,” he said. “The ideas that\ncome from me and my team would have been completely irrelevant, nowhere, if Steve\nhadn’t been here to push us, work with us, and drive through all the resistance to turn\nour ideas into products.”\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\nTHE iMAC\nHello (Again)\nBack to the Future\nThe first great design triumph to come from the Jobs-Ive collaboration was the iMac, a\ndesktop computer aimed at the home consumer market that was introduced in May 1998.\nJobs had certain specifications. It should be an all-in-one product, with keyboard and\nmonitor and computer ready to use right out of the box. It should have a distinctive\ndesign that made a brand statement. And it should sell for $1,200 or so. (Apple had no\ncomputer selling for less than $2,000 at the time.) “He told us to go back to the roots of\nthe  original  1984  Macintosh,  an  all-in-one  consumer  appliance,”  recalled  Schiller.\n“That meant design and engineering had to work together.”\n\nThe  initial  plan  was  to  build  a  “network  computer,”  a  concept  championed  by\nOracle’s Larry Ellison, which was an inexpensive terminal without a hard drive that\nwould mainly be used to connect to the Internet and other networks. But Apple’s chief\nfinancial officer Fred Anderson led the push to make the product more robust by adding\na disk drive so it could become a full-fledged desktop computer for the home. Jobs\neventually agreed.\nJon Rubinstein, who was in charge of hardware, adapted the microprocessor and\nguts  of  the  PowerMac  G3,  Apple’s  high-end  professional  computer,  for  use  in  the\nproposed new machine. It would have a hard drive and a tray for compact disks, but in\na rather bold move, Jobs and Rubinstein decided not to include the usual floppy disk\ndrive. Jobs quoted the hockey star Wayne Gretzky’s maxim, “Skate where the puck’s\ngoing,  not  where  it’s  been.”  He  was  a  bit  ahead  of  his  time,  but  eventually  most\ncomputers eliminated floppy disks.\nIve and his top deputy, Danny Coster, began to sketch out futuristic designs. Jobs\nbrusquely rejected the dozen foam models they initially produced, but Ive knew how to\nguide him gently. Ive agreed that none of them was quite right, but he pointed out one\nthat had promise. It was curved, playful looking, and did not seem like an unmovable\nslab rooted to the table. “It has a sense that it’s just arrived on your desktop or it’s just\nabout to hop off and go somewhere,” he told Jobs.\nBy the next showing Ive had refined the playful model. This time Jobs, with his\nbinary view of the world, raved that he loved it. He took the foam prototype and began\ncarrying  it  around  the  headquarters  with  him,  showing  it  in  confidence  to  trusted\nlieutenants and board members. In its ads Apple was celebrating the glories of being\nable to think different, yet until now nothing had been proposed that was much different\nfrom existing computers. Finally, Jobs had something new.\nThe plastic casing that Ive and Coster proposed was sea-green blue, later named\nbondi blue after the color of the water at a beach in Australia, and it was translucent so\nthat you could see through to the inside of the machine. “We were trying to convey a\nsense of the computer being changeable based on your needs, to be like a chameleon,”\nsaid Ive. “That’s why we liked the translucency. You could have color but it felt so\nunstatic. And it came across as cheeky.”\nBoth metaphorically and in reality, the translucency connected the inner engineering\nof the computer to the outer design. Jobs had always insisted that the rows of chips on\nthe circuit boards look neat, even though they would never be seen. Now they would be\nseen. The casing would make visible the care that had gone into making all components\nof the computer and fitting them together. The playful design would convey simplicity\nwhile also revealing the depths that true simplicity entails.\nEven the simplicity of the plastic shell itself involved great complexity. Ive and his\nteam worked with Apple’s Korean manufacturers to perfect the process of making the\ncases, and they even went to a jelly bean factory to study how to make translucent\ncolors look enticing. The cost of each case was more than $60 per unit, three times that\n\nof  a  regular  computer  case.  Other  companies  would  probably  have  demanded\npresentations and studies to show whether the translucent case would increase sales\nenough to justify the extra cost. Jobs asked for no such analysis.\nTopping off the design was the handle nestled into the iMac. It was more playful and\nsemiotic than it was functional. This was a desktop computer; not many people were\nreally going to carry it around. But as Ive later explained:\nBack then, people weren’t comfortable with technology. If you’re scared of something,\nthen you won’t touch it. I could see my mum being scared to touch it. So I thought, if\nthere’s  this  handle  on  it,  it  makes  a  relationship  possible.  It’s  approachable.  It’s\nintuitive. It gives you permission to touch. It gives a sense of its deference to you.\nUnfortunately, manufacturing a recessed handle costs a lot of money. At the old Apple, I\nwould have lost the argument. What was really great about Steve is that he saw it and\nsaid, “That’s cool!” I didn’t explain all the thinking, but he intuitively got it. He just\nknew that it was part of the iMac’s friendliness and playfulness.\nJobs had to fend off the objections of the manufacturing engineers, supported by\nRubinstein, who tended to raise practical cost considerations when faced with Ive’s\naesthetic desires and various design whims. “When we took it to the engineers,” Jobs\nsaid, “they came up with thirty-eight reasons they couldn’t do it. And I said, ‘No, no,\nwe’re doing this.’ And they said, ‘Well, why?’ And I said, ‘Because I’m the CEO, and I\nthink it can be done.’ And so they kind of grudgingly did it.”\nJobs asked Lee Clow and Ken Segall and others from the TBWA\\ Chiat\\Day ad team\nto fly up to see what he had in the works. He brought them into the guarded design\nstudio  and  dramatically  unveiled  Ive’s  translucent  teardrop-shaped  design,  which\nlooked like something from The Jetsons, the animated TV show set in the future. For a\nmoment they were taken aback. “We were pretty shocked, but we couldn’t be frank,”\nSegall recalled. “We were really thinking, ‘Jesus, do they know what they are doing?’ It\nwas so radical.” Jobs asked them to suggest names. Segall came back with five options,\none of them “iMac.” Jobs didn’t like any of them at first, so Segall came up with another\nlist a week later, but he said that the agency still preferred “iMac.” Jobs replied, “I\ndon’t hate it this week, but I still don’t like it.” He tried silk-screening it on some of the\nprototypes, and the name grew on him. And thus it became the iMac.\nAs  the  deadline for  completing  the  iMac  drew  near,  Jobs’s  legendary  temper\nreappeared in force, especially when he was confronting manufacturing issues. At one\nproduct review meeting, he learned that the process was going slowly. “He did one of\nhis displays of awesome fury, and the fury was absolutely pure,” recalled Ive. He went\naround the table assailing everyone, starting with Rubinstein. “You know we’re trying to\nsave the company here,” he shouted, “and you guys are screwing it up!”\n\nLike the original Macintosh team, the iMac crew staggered to completion just in time\nfor the big announcement. But not before Jobs had one last explosion. When it came\ntime to rehearse for the launch presentation, Rubinstein cobbled together two working\nprototypes. Jobs had not seen the final product before, and when he looked at it onstage\nhe saw a button on the front, under the display. He pushed it and the CD tray opened.\n“What the fuck is this?!?” he asked, though not as politely. “None of us said anything,”\nSchiller recalled, “because he obviously knew what a CD tray was.” So Jobs continued\nto rail. It was supposed to have a clean CD slot, he insisted, referring to the elegant slot\ndrives that were already to be found in upscale cars. “Steve, this is exactly the drive I\nshowed you when we talked about the components,” Rubinstein explained. “No, there\nwas never a tray, just a slot,” Jobs insisted. Rubinstein didn’t back down. Jobs’s fury\ndidn’t abate. “I almost started crying, because it was too late to do anything about it,”\nJobs later recalled.\nThey suspended the rehearsal, and for a while it seemed as if Jobs might cancel the\nentire product launch. “Ruby looked at me as if to say, ‘Am I crazy?’” Schiller recalled.\n“It was my first product launch with Steve and the first time I saw his mind-set of ‘If it’s\nnot right we’re not launching it.’” Finally, they agreed to replace the tray with a slot\ndrive for the next version of the iMac. “I’m only going to go ahead with the launch if\nyou promise we’re going to go to slot mode as soon as possible,” Jobs said tearfully.\nThere was also a problem with the video he planned to show. In it, Jony Ive is\nshown describing his design thinking and asking, “What computer would the Jetsons\nhave had? It was like, the future yesterday.” At that moment there was a two-second\nsnippet from the cartoon show, showing Jane Jetson looking at a video screen, followed\nby another two-second clip of the Jetsons giggling by a Christmas tree. At a rehearsal a\nproduction assistant told Jobs they would have to remove the clips because Hanna-\nBarbera had not given permission to use them. “Keep it in,” Jobs barked at him. The\nassistant explained that there were rules against that. “I don’t care,” Jobs said. “We’re\nusing it.” The clip stayed in.\nLee Clow was preparing a series of colorful magazine ads, and when he sent Jobs\nthe page proofs he got an outraged phone call in response. The blue in the ad, Jobs\ninsisted, was different from that of the iMac. “You guys don’t know what you’re doing!”\nJobs shouted. “I’m going to get someone else to do the ads, because this is fucked up.”\nClow argued back. Compare them, he said. Jobs, who was not in the office, insisted he\nwas right and continued to shout. Eventually Clow got him to sit down with the original\nphotographs. “I finally proved to him that the blue was the blue was the blue.” Years\nlater, on a Steve Jobs discussion board on the website Gawker, the following tale\nappeared from someone who had worked at the Whole Foods store in Palo Alto a few\nblocks from Jobs’s home: “I was shagging carts one afternoon when I saw this silver\nMercedes parked in a handicapped spot. Steve Jobs was inside screaming at his car\nphone. This was right before the first iMac was unveiled and I’m pretty sure I could\nmake out, ‘Not. Fucking. Blue. Enough!!!’”\n\nAs always, Jobs was compulsive in preparing for the dramatic unveiling. Having\nstopped one rehearsal because he was angry about the CD drive tray, he stretched out\nthe other rehearsals to make sure the show would be stellar. He repeatedly went over\nthe climactic moment when he would walk across the stage and proclaim, “Say hello to\nthe new iMac.” He wanted the lighting to be perfect so that the translucence of the new\nmachine would be vivid. But after a few run-throughs he was still unsatisfied, an echo\nof his obsession with stage lighting that Sculley had witnessed at the rehearsals for the\noriginal 1984 Macintosh launch. He ordered the lights to be brighter and come on\nearlier, but that still didn’t please him. So he jogged down the auditorium aisle and\nslouched into a center seat, draping his legs over the seat in front. “Let’s keep doing it\ntill  we  get  it  right,  okay?”  he  said.  They  made  another  attempt.  “No,  no,”  Jobs\ncomplained. “This isn’t working at all.” The next time, the lights were bright enough,\nbut they came on too late. “I’m getting tired of asking about this,” Jobs growled. Finally,\nthe iMac shone just right. “Oh! Right there! That’s great!” Jobs yelled.\nA year earlier Jobs had ousted Mike Markkula, his early mentor and partner, from\nthe board. But he was so proud of what he had wrought with the new iMac, and so\nsentimental about its connection to the original Macintosh, that he invited Markkula to\nCupertino for a private preview. Markkula was impressed. His only objection was to\nthe new mouse that Ive had designed. It looked like a hockey puck, Markkula said, and\npeople would hate it. Jobs disagreed, but Markkula was right. Otherwise the machine\nhad turned out to be, as had its predecessor, insanely great.\nThe Launch, May 6, 1998\nWith the launch of the original Macintosh in 1984, Jobs had created a new kind of\ntheater: the product debut as an epochal event, climaxed by a let-there-be-light moment\nin which the skies part, a light shines down, the angels sing, and a chorus of the chosen\nfaithful sings “Hallelujah.” For the grand unveiling of the product that he hoped would\nsave Apple and again transform personal computing, Jobs symbolically chose the Flint\nAuditorium of De Anza Community College in Cupertino, the same venue he had used in\n1984. He would be pulling out all the stops in order to dispel doubts, rally the troops,\nenlist support in the developers’ community, and jump-start the marketing of the new\nmachine. But he was also doing it because he enjoyed playing impresario. Putting on a\ngreat show piqued his passions in the same way as putting out a great product.\nDisplaying his sentimental side, he began with a graceful shout-out to three people\nhe had invited to be up front in the audience. He had become estranged from all of them,\nbut now he wanted them rejoined. “I started the company with Steve Wozniak in my\nparents’ garage, and Steve is here today,” he said, pointing him out and prompting\napplause. “We were joined by Mike Markkula and soon after that our first president,\n\nMike Scott,” he continued. “Both of those folks are in the audience today. And none of\nus  would  be  here  without  these  three  guys.”  His  eyes  misted  for  a  moment  as  the\napplause again built. Also in the audience were Andy Hertzfeld and most of the original\nMac team. Jobs gave them a smile. He believed he was about to do them proud.\nAfter showing the grid of Apple’s new product strategy and going through some\nslides about the new computer’s performance, he was ready to unveil his new baby.\n“This is what computers look like today,” he said as a picture of a beige set of boxy\ncomponents and monitor was projected on the big screen behind him. “And I’d like to\ntake the privilege of showing you what they are going to look like from today on.” He\npulled the cloth from the table at center stage to reveal the new iMac, which gleamed\nand sparkled as the lights came up on cue. He pressed the mouse, and as at the launch of\nthe original Macintosh, the screen flashed with fast-paced images of all the wondrous\nthings the computer could do. At the end, the word “hello” appeared in the same playful\nscript that had adorned the 1984 Macintosh, this time with the word “again” below it in\nparentheses: Hello  (again).  There  was  thunderous  applause.  Jobs  stood  back  and\nproudly gazed at his new Macintosh. “It looks like it’s from another planet,” he said, as\nthe audience laughed. “A good planet. A planet with better designers.”\nOnce again Jobs had produced an iconic new product, this one a harbinger of a new\nmillennium. It fulfilled the promise of “Think Different.” Instead of beige boxes and\nmonitors with a welter of cables and a bulky setup manual, here was a friendly and\nspunky appliance, smooth to the touch and as pleasing to the eye as a robin’s egg. You\ncould grab its cute little handle and lift it out of the elegant white box and plug it right\ninto a wall socket. People who had been afraid of computers now wanted one, and they\nwanted to put it in a room where others could admire and perhaps covet it. “A piece of\nhardware that blends sci-fi shimmer with the kitsch whimsy of a cocktail umbrella,”\nSteven  Levy  wrote  in Newsweek,  “it  is  not  only  the  coolest-looking  computer\nintroduced in years, but a chest-thumping statement that Silicon Valley’s original dream\ncompany is no longer somnambulant.” Forbes called it “an industry-altering success,”\nand John Sculley later came out of exile to gush, “He has implemented the same simple\nstrategy that made Apple so successful 15 years ago: make hit products and promote\nthem with terrific marketing.”\nCarping was heard from only one familiar corner. As the iMac garnered kudos, Bill\nGates assured a gathering of financial analysts visiting Microsoft that this would be a\npassing fad. “The one thing Apple’s providing now is leadership in colors,” Gates said\nas he pointed to a Windows-based PC that he jokingly had painted red. “It won’t take\nlong for us to catch up with that, I don’t think.” Jobs was furious, and he told a reporter\nthat Gates, the man he had publicly decried for being completely devoid of taste, was\nclueless about what made the iMac so much more appealing than other computers. “The\nthing that our competitors are missing is that they think it’s about fashion, and they think\nit’s about surface appearance,” he said. “They say, We’ll slap a little color on this piece\nof junk computer, and we’ll have one, too.”\n\nThe iMac went on sale in August 1998 for $1,299. It sold 278,000 units in its first\nsix weeks, and would sell 800,000 by the end of the year, making it the fastest-selling\ncomputer in Apple history. Most notably, 32% of the sales went to people who were\nbuying a computer for the first time, and another 12% to people who had been using\nWindows machines.\nIve soon came up with four new juicy-looking colors, in addition to bondi blue, for\nthe iMacs. Offering the same computer in five colors would of course create huge\nchallenges for manufacturing, inventory, and distribution. At most companies, including\neven the old Apple, there would have been studies and meetings to look at the costs and\nbenefits. But when Jobs looked at the new colors, he got totally psyched and summoned\nother executives over to the design studio. “We’re going to do all sorts of colors!” he\ntold them excitedly. When they left, Ive looked at his team in amazement. “In most\nplaces that decision would have taken months,” Ive recalled. “Steve did it in a half\nhour.”\nThere was one other important refinement that Jobs wanted for the iMac: getting rid\nof that detested CD tray. “I’d seen a slot-load drive on a very high-end Sony stereo,” he\nsaid, “so I went to the drive manufacturers and got them to do a slot-load drive for us\nfor the version of the iMac we did nine months later.” Rubinstein tried to argue him out\nof the change. He predicted that new drives would come along that could burn music\nonto CDs rather than merely play them, and they would be available in tray form before\nthey were made to work in slots. “If you go to slots, you will always be behind on the\ntechnology,” Rubinstein argued.\n“I don’t care, that’s what I want,” Jobs snapped back. They were having lunch at a\nsushi bar in San Francisco, and Jobs insisted that they continue the conversation over a\nwalk. “I want you to do the slot-load drive for me as a personal favor,” Jobs asked.\nRubinstein agreed, of course, but he turned out to be right. Panasonic came out with a\nCD drive that could rip and burn music, and it was available first for computers that had\nold-fashioned tray loaders. The effects of this would ripple over the next few years: It\nwould cause Apple to be slow in catering to users who wanted to rip and burn their\nown music, but that would then force Apple to be imaginative and bold in finding a way\nto leapfrog over its competitors when Jobs finally realized that he had to get into the\nmusic market.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\nCEO\nStill Crazy after All These Years\nTim Cook and Jobs, 2007\nTim Cook\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple and produced the “Think Different” ads and the\niMac in his first year, it confirmed what most people already knew: that he could be\ncreative and a visionary. He had shown that during his first round at Apple. What was\nless clear was whether he could run a company. He had definitely not shown that during\nhis first round.\n\nJobs threw himself into the task with a detail-oriented realism that astonished those\nwho were used to his fantasy that the rules of this universe need not apply to him. “He\nbecame a manager, which is different from being an executive or visionary, and that\npleasantly surprised me,” recalled Ed Woolard, the board chair who lured him back.\nHis management mantra was “Focus.” He eliminated excess product lines and cut\nextraneous features in the new operating system software that Apple was developing.\nHe let go of his control-freak desire to manufacture products in his own factories and\ninstead outsourced the making of everything from the circuit boards to the finished\ncomputers. And he enforced on Apple’s suppliers a rigorous discipline. When he took\nover, Apple had more than two months’ worth of inventory sitting in warehouses, more\nthan any other tech company. Like eggs and milk, computers have a short shelf life, so\nthis amounted to at least a $500 million hit to profits. By early 1998 he had halved that\nto a month.\nJobs’s successes came at a cost, since velvety diplomacy was still not part of his\nrepertoire. When he decided that a division of Airborne Express wasn’t delivering\nspare parts quickly enough, he ordered an Apple manager to break the contract. When\nthe manager protested that doing so could lead to a lawsuit, Jobs replied, “Just tell them\nif they fuck with us, they’ll never get another fucking dime from this company, ever.”\nThe manager quit, there was a lawsuit, and it took a year to resolve. “My stock options\nwould be worth $10 million had I stayed,” the manager said, “but I knew I couldn’t\nhave stood it—and he’d have fired me anyway.” The new distributor was ordered to cut\ninventory 75%, and did. “Under Steve Jobs, there’s zero tolerance for not performing,”\nits CEO said. At another point, when VLSI Technology was having trouble delivering\nenough chips on time, Jobs stormed into a meeting and started shouting that they were\n“fucking dickless assholes.” The company ended up getting the chips to Apple on time,\nand its executives made jackets that boasted on the back, “Team FDA.”\nAfter three months of working under Jobs, Apple’s head of operations decided he\ncould not bear the pressure, and he quit. For almost a year Jobs ran operations himself,\nbecause  all  the  prospects  he  interviewed  “seemed  like  they  were  old-wave\nmanufacturing people,” he recalled. He wanted someone who could build just-in-time\nfactories and supply chains, as Michael Dell had done. Then, in 1998, he met Tim Cook,\na  courtly  thirty-seven-year-old  procurement  and  supply  chain  manager  at  Compaq\nComputers, who not only would become his operations manager but would grow into an\nindispensable backstage partner in running Apple. As Jobs recalled:\nTim Cook came out of procurement, which is just the right background for what we\nneeded. I realized that he and I saw things exactly the same way. I had visited a lot of\njust-in-time factories in Japan, and I’d built one for the Mac and at NeXT. I knew what I\nwanted, and I met Tim, and he wanted the same thing. So we started to work together,\nand before long I trusted him to know exactly what to do. He had the same vision I did,\n\nand we could interact at a high strategic level, and I could just forget about a lot of\nthings unless he came and pinged me.\nCook, the son of a shipyard worker, was raised in Robertsdale, Alabama, a small\ntown between Mobile and Pensacola a half hour from the Gulf Coast. He majored in\nindustrial engineering at Auburn, got a business degree at Duke, and for the next twelve\nyears  worked  for  IBM  in  the  Research  Triangle  of  North  Carolina.  When  Jobs\ninterviewed him, he had recently taken a job at Compaq. He had always been a very\nlogical engineer, and Compaq then seemed a more sensible career option, but he was\nsnared by Jobs’s aura. “Five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to\nthrow caution and logic to the wind and join Apple,” he later said. “My intuition told\nme that joining Apple would be a oncein-a-lifetime opportunity to work for a creative\ngenius.” And so he did. “Engineers are taught to make a decision analytically, but there\nare times when relying on gut or intuition is most indispensable.”\nAt Apple his role became implementing Jobs’s intuition, which he accomplished\nwith a quiet diligence. Never married, he threw himself into his work. He was up most\ndays at 4:30 sending emails, then spent an hour at the gym, and was at his desk shortly\nafter 6. He scheduled Sunday evening conference calls to prepare for each week ahead.\nIn a company that was led by a CEO prone to tantrums and withering blasts, Cook\ncommanded situations with a calm demeanor, a soothing Alabama accent, and silent\nstares. “Though he’s capable of mirth, Cook’s default facial expression is a frown, and\nhis humor is of the dry variety,” Adam Lashinsky wrote in Fortune. “In meetings he’s\nknown for long, uncomfortable pauses, when all you hear is the sound of his tearing the\nwrapper off the energy bars he constantly eats.”\nAt a meeting early in his tenure, Cook was told of a problem with one of Apple’s\nChinese suppliers. “This is really bad,” he said. “Someone should be in China driving\nthis.” Thirty minutes later he looked at an operations executive sitting at the table and\nunemotionally asked, “Why are you still here?” The executive stood up, drove directly\nto the San Francisco airport, and bought a ticket to China. He became one of Cook’s top\ndeputies.\nCook reduced the number of Apple’s key suppliers from a hundred to twenty-four,\nforced them to cut better deals to keep the business, convinced many to locate next to\nApple’s plants, and closed ten of the company’s nineteen warehouses. By reducing the\nplaces where inventory could pile up, he reduced inventory. Jobs had cut inventory from\ntwo months’ worth of product down to one by early 1998. By September of that year,\nCook had gotten it down to six days. By the following September, it was down to an\namazing two days’ worth. In addition, he cut the production process for making an\nApple computer from four months to two. All of this not only saved money, it also\nallowed each new computer to have the very latest components available.\n\nMock Turtlenecks and Teamwork\nOn a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony’s chairman, Akio Morita, why\neveryone in his company’s factories wore uniforms. “He looked very ashamed and told\nme that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their\nworkers  something  to  wear  each  day,”  Jobs  recalled.  Over  the  years  the  uniforms\ndeveloped  their  own  signature  style,  especially  at  companies  such  as  Sony,  and  it\nbecame a way of bonding workers to the company. “I decided that I wanted that type of\nbonding for Apple,” Jobs recalled.\nSony, with its appreciation for style, had gotten the famous designer Issey Miyake to\ncreate one of its uniforms. It was a jacket made of ripstop nylon with sleeves that could\nunzip to make it a vest. “So I called Issey and asked him to design a vest for Apple,”\nJobs recalled. “I came back with some samples and told everyone it would be great if\nwe would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated\nthe idea.”\nIn  the  process,  however,  he  became  friends  with  Miyake  and  would  visit  him\nregularly. He also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, because of both\nits daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature\nstyle. “So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he\nmade me like a hundred of them.” Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so\nhe gestured to them stacked up in the closet. “That’s what I wear,” he said. “I have\nenough to last for the rest of my life.”\nDespite his autocratic nature—he never worshipped at the altar of consensus—Jobs\nworked  hard  to  foster  a  culture  of  collaboration  at  Apple.  Many  companies  pride\nthemselves on having few meetings. Jobs had many: an executive staff session every\nMonday, a marketing strategy session all Wednesday afternoon, and endless product\nreview sessions. Still allergic to PowerPoints and formal presentations, he insisted that\nthe people around the table hash out issues from various vantages and the perspectives\nof different departments.\nBecause he believed that Apple’s great advantage was its integration of the whole\nwidget—from design to hardware to software to content—he wanted all departments at\nthe  company  to  work  together  in  parallel.  The  phrases  he  used  were  “deep\ncollaboration”  and  “concurrent  engineering.”  Instead  of  a  development  process  in\nwhich  a  product  would  be  passed  sequentially  from  engineering  to  design  to\nmanufacturing  to  marketing  and  distribution,  these  various  departments  collaborated\nsimultaneously. “Our method was to develop integrated products, and that meant our\nprocess had to be integrated and collaborative,” Jobs said.\nThis approach also applied to key hires. He would have candidates meet the top\nleaders—Cook, Tevanian, Schiller, Rubinstein, Ive—rather than just the managers of the\ndepartment where they wanted to work. “Then we all get together without the person\n\nand talk about whether they’ll fit in,” Jobs said. His goal was to be vigilant against “the\nbozo explosion” that leads to a company’s being larded with second-rate talent:\nFor most things in life, the range between best and average is 30% or so. The best\nairplane flight, the best meal, they may be 30% better than your average one. What I saw\nwith Woz was somebody who was fifty times better than the average engineer. He could\nhave meetings in his head. The Mac team was an attempt to build a whole team like that,\nA players. People said they wouldn’t get along, they’d hate working with each other.\nBut I realized that A players like to work with A players, they just didn’t like working\nwith C players. At Pixar, it was a whole company of A players. When I got back to\nApple, that’s what I decided to try to do. You need to have a collaborative hiring\nprocess. When we hire someone, even if they’re going to be in marketing, I will have\nthem  talk  to  the  design  folks  and  the  engineers.  My  role  model  was  J.  Robert\nOppenheimer. I read about the type of people he sought for the atom bomb project. I\nwasn’t nearly as good as he was, but that’s what I aspired to do.\nThe process could be intimidating, but Jobs had an eye for talent. When they were\nlooking for people to design the graphical interface for Apple’s new operating system,\nJobs got an email from a young man and invited him in. The applicant was nervous, and\nthe meeting did not go well. Later that day Jobs bumped into him, dejected, sitting in the\nlobby. The guy asked if he could just show him one of his ideas, so Jobs looked over his\nshoulder and saw a little demo, using Adobe Director, of a way to fit more icons in the\ndock at the bottom of a screen. When the guy moved the cursor over the icons crammed\ninto the dock, the cursor mimicked a magnifying glass and made each icon balloon\nbigger.  “I  said,  ‘My  God,’  and  hired  him  on  the  spot,”  Jobs  recalled.  The  feature\nbecame a lovable part of Mac OSX, and the designer went on to design such things as\ninertial scrolling for multi-touch screens (the delightful feature that makes the screen\nkeep gliding for a moment after you’ve finished swiping).\nJobs’s experiences at NeXT had matured him, but they had not mellowed him much.\nHe still had no license plate on his Mercedes, and he still parked in the handicapped\nspaces next to the front door, sometimes straddling two slots. It became a running gag.\nEmployees  made  signs  saying,  “Park  Different,”  and  someone  painted  over  the\nhandicapped wheelchair symbol with a Mercedes logo.\nPeople were allowed, even encouraged, to challenge him, and sometimes he would\nrespect them for it. But you had to be prepared for him to attack you, even bite your\nhead off, as he processed your ideas. “You never win an argument with him at the time,\nbut sometimes you eventually win,” said James Vincent, the creative young adman who\nworked with Lee Clow. “You propose something and he declares, ‘That’s a stupid\nidea,’ and later he comes back and says, ‘Here’s what we’re going to do.’ And you\n\nwant to say, ‘That’s what I told you two weeks ago and you said that’s a stupid idea.’\nBut you can’t do that. Instead you say, ‘That’s a great idea, let’s do that.’”\nPeople also had to put up with Jobs’s occasional irrational or incorrect assertions.\nTo both family and colleagues, he was apt to declare, with great conviction, some\nscientific  or  historical  fact  that  had  scant  relationship  to  reality.  “There  can  be\nsomething he knows absolutely nothing about, and because of his crazy style and utter\nconviction, he can convince people that he knows what he’s talking about,” said Ive,\nwho  described  the  trait  as  weirdly  endearing.  Yet  with  his  eye  for  detail,  Jobs\nsometimes  correctly  pounced  on  tiny  things  others  had  missed.  Lee  Clow  recalled\nshowing Jobs a cut of a commercial, making some minor changes he requested, and then\nbeing assaulted with a tirade about how the ad had been completely destroyed. “He\ndiscovered we had cut two extra frames, something so fleeting it was nearly impossible\nto notice,” said Clow. “But he wanted to be sure that an image hit at the exact moment as\na beat of the music, and he was totally right.”\nFrom iCEO to CEO\nEd Woolard, his mentor on the Apple board, pressed Jobs for more than two years to\ndrop the interim in front of his CEO title. Not only was Jobs refusing to commit himself,\nbut he was baffling everyone by taking only $1 a year in pay and no stock options. “I\nmake 50 cents for showing up,” he liked to joke, “and the other 50 cents is based on\nperformance.” Since his return in July 1997, Apple stock had gone from just under $14\nto just over $102 at the peak of the Internet bubble at the beginning of 2000. Woolard\nhad  begged  him  to  take  at  least  a  modest  stock  grant  back  in  1997,  but  Jobs  had\ndeclined, saying, “I don’t want the people I work with at Apple to think I am coming\nback to get rich.” Had he accepted that modest grant, it would have been worth $400\nmillion. Instead he made $2.50 during that period.\nThe main reason he clung to his interim designation was a sense of uncertainty about\nApple’s future. But as 2000 approached, it was clear that Apple had rebounded, and it\nwas because of him. He took a long walk with Laurene and discussed what to most\npeople by now seemed a formality but to him was still a big deal. If he dropped the\ninterim designation, Apple could be the base for all the things he envisioned, including\nthe possibility of getting Apple into products beyond computers. He decided to do so.\nWoolard was thrilled, and he suggested that the board was willing to give him a\nmassive stock grant. “Let me be straight with you,” Jobs replied. “What I’d rather have\nis an airplane. We just had a third kid. I don’t like flying commercial. I like to take my\nfamily to Hawaii. When I go east, I’d like to have pilots I know.” He was never the type\nof person who could display grace and patience in a commercial airplane or terminal,\neven before the days of the TSA. Board member Larry Ellison, whose plane Jobs\n\nsometimes used (Apple paid $102,000 to Ellison in 1999 for Jobs’s use of it), had no\nqualms. “Given what he’s accomplished, we should give him five airplanes!” Ellison\nargued. He later said, “It was the perfect thank-you gift for Steve, who had saved Apple\nand gotten nothing in return.”\nSo Woolard happily granted Jobs’s wish, with a Gulfstream V, and also offered him\nfourteen million stock options. Jobs gave an unexpected response. He wanted more:\ntwenty million options. Woolard was baffled and upset. The board had authority from\nthe stockholders to give out only fourteen million. “You said you didn’t want any, and\nwe gave you a plane, which you did want,” Woolard said.\n“I hadn’t been insisting on options before,” Jobs replied, “but you suggested it could\nbe up to 5% of the company in options, and that’s what I now want.” It was an awkward\ntiff in what should have been a celebratory period. In the end, a complex solution was\nworked out that granted him ten million shares in January 2000 that were valued at the\ncurrent price but timed to vest as if granted in 1997, plus another grant due in 2001.\nMaking matters worse, the stock fell with the burst of the Internet bubble. Jobs never\nexercised the options, and at the end of 2001 he asked that they be replaced by a new\ngrant with a lower strike price. The wrestling over options would come back to haunt\nthe company.\nEven if he didn’t profit from the options, at least he got to enjoy the airplane. Not\nsurprisingly he fretted over how the interior would be designed. It took him more than a\nyear. He used Ellison’s plane as a starting point and hired his designer. Pretty soon he\nwas driving her crazy. For example, Ellison’s had a door between cabins with an open\nbutton and a close button. Jobs insisted that his have a single button that toggled. He\ndidn’t like the polished stainless steel of the buttons, so he had them replaced with\nbrushed metal ones. But in the end he got the plane he wanted, and he loved it. “I look at\nhis airplane and mine, and everything he changed was better,” said Ellison.\nAt the January 2000 Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs rolled out the new Macintosh\noperating system, OSX, which used some of the software that Apple had bought from\nNeXT  three  years  earlier.  It  was  fitting,  and  not  entirely  coincidental,  that  he  was\nwilling to incorporate himself back at Apple at the same moment as the NeXT OS was\nincorporated into Apple’s. Avie Tevanian had taken the UNIX-related Mach kernel of\nthe NeXT operating system and turned it into the Mac OS kernel, known as Darwin. It\noffered protected memory, advanced networking, and preemptive multitasking. It was\nprecisely what the Macintosh needed, and it would be the foundation of the Mac OS\nhenceforth. Some critics, including Bill Gates, noted that Apple ended up not adopting\nthe entire NeXT operating system. There’s some truth to that, because Apple decided\nnot  to  leap  into  a  completely  new  system  but  instead  to  evolve  the  existing  one.\nApplication software written for the old Macintosh system was generally compatible\nwith or easy to port to the new one, and a Mac user who upgraded would notice a lot of\nnew features but not a whole new interface.\n\nThe  fans  at  Macworld  received  the  news  with  enthusiasm,  of  course,  and  they\nespecially cheered when Jobs showed off the dock and how the icons in it could be\nmagnified  by  passing  the  cursor  over  them.  But  the  biggest  applause  came  for  the\nannouncement he reserved for his “Oh, and one more thing” coda. He spoke about his\nduties  at  both  Pixar  and  Apple,  and  said  that  he  had  become  comfortable  that  the\nsituation could work. “So I am pleased to announce today that I’m going to drop the\ninterim title,” he said with a big smile. The crowd jumped to its feet, screaming as if the\nBeatles had reunited. Jobs bit his lip, adjusted his wire rims, and put on a graceful show\nof humility. “You guys are making me feel funny now. I get to come to work every day\nand work with the most talented people on the planet, at Apple and Pixar. But these jobs\nare team sports. I accept your thanks on behalf of everybody at Apple.”\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\nAPPLE STORES\nGenius Bars and Siena Sandstone\nNew York’s Fifth Avenue store\nThe Customer Experience\nJobs hated to cede control of anything, especially when it might affect the customer\nexperience.  But  he  faced  a  problem.  There  was  one  part  of  the  process  he  didn’t\ncontrol: the experience of buying an Apple product in a store.\nThe  days  of  the  Byte  Shop  were  over.  Industry  sales  were  shifting  from  local\ncomputer specialty shops to megachains and big box stores, where most clerks had\nneither  the  knowledge  nor  the  incentive  to  explain  the  distinctive  nature  of  Apple\nproducts.  “All  that  the  salesman  cared  about  was  a  $50  spiff,”  Jobs  said.  Other\ncomputers were pretty generic, but Apple’s had innovative features and a higher price\ntag. He didn’t want an iMac to sit on a shelf between a Dell and a Compaq while an\n\nuninformed clerk recited the specs of each. “Unless we could find ways to get our\nmessage to customers at the store, we were screwed.”\nIn great secrecy, Jobs began in late 1999 to interview executives who might be able\nto develop a string of Apple retail stores. One of the candidates had a passion for\ndesign  and  the  boyish  enthusiasm  of  a  natural-born  retailer:  Ron  Johnson,  the  vice\npresident for merchandising at Target, who was responsible for launching distinctive-\nlooking products, such as a teakettle designed by Michael Graves. “Steve is very easy\nto talk to,” said Johnson in recalling their first meeting. “All of a sudden there’s a torn\npair of jeans and turtleneck, and he’s off and running about why he needed great stores.\nIf Apple is going to succeed, he told me, we’re going to win on innovation. And you\ncan’t win on innovation unless you have a way to communicate to customers.”\nWhen Johnson came back in January 2000 to be interviewed again, Jobs suggested\nthat they take a walk. They went to the sprawling 140 store Stanford Shopping Mall at\n8:30 a.m. The stores weren’t open yet, so they walked up and down the entire mall\nrepeatedly and discussed how it was organized, what role the big department stores\nplayed relative to the other stores, and why certain specialty shops were successful.\nThey were still walking and talking when the stores opened at 10, and they went into\nEddie  Bauer.  It  had  an  entrance  off  the  mall  and  another  off  the  parking  lot.  Jobs\ndecided that Apple stores should have only one entrance, which would make it easier to\ncontrol  the  experience.  And  the  Eddie  Bauer  store,  they  agreed,  was  too  long  and\nnarrow. It was important that customers intuitively grasp the layout of a store as soon as\nthey entered.\nThere were no tech stores in the mall, and Johnson explained why: The conventional\nwisdom was that a consumer, when making a major and infrequent purchase such as a\ncomputer, would be willing to drive to a less convenient location, where the rent would\nbe cheaper. Jobs disagreed. Apple stores should be in malls and on Main Streets—in\nareas with a lot of foot traffic, no matter how expensive. “We may not be able to get\nthem to drive ten miles to check out our products, but we can get them to walk ten feet,”\nhe said. The Windows users, in particular, had to be ambushed: “If they’re passing by,\nthey will drop in out of curiosity, if we make it inviting enough, and once we get a\nchance to show them what we have, we will win.”\nJohnson said that the size of a store signaled the importance of the brand. “Is Apple\nas big of a brand as the Gap?” he asked. Jobs said it was much bigger. Johnson replied\nthat its stores should therefore be bigger. “Otherwise you won’t be relevant.” Jobs\ndescribed Mike Markkula’s maxim that a good company must “impute”—it must convey\nits values and importance in everything it does, from packaging to marketing. Johnson\nloved it. It definitely applied to a company’s stores. “The store will become the most\npowerful physical expression of the brand,” he predicted. He said that when he was\nyoung he had gone to the wood-paneled, art-filled mansion-like store that Ralph Lauren\nhad created at Seventy-second and Madison in Manhattan. “Whenever I buy a polo shirt,\nI think of that mansion, which was a physical expression of Ralph’s ideals,” Johnson\n\nsaid. “Mickey Drexler did that with the Gap. You couldn’t think of a Gap product\nwithout thinking of the great Gap store with the clean space and wood floors and white\nwalls and folded merchandise.”\nWhen they finished, they drove to Apple and sat in a conference room playing with\nthe  company’s  products.  There  weren’t  many,  not  enough  to  fill  the  shelves  of  a\nconventional store, but that was an advantage. The type of store they would build, they\ndecided, would benefit from having few products. It would be minimalist and airy and\noffer a lot of places for people to try out things. “Most people don’t know Apple\nproducts,” Johnson said. “They think of Apple as a cult. You want to move from a cult\nto something cool, and having an awesome store where people can try things will help\nthat.” The stores would impute the ethos of Apple products: playful, easy, creative, and\non the bright side of the line between hip and intimidating.\nThe Prototype\nWhen Jobs finally presented the idea, the board was not thrilled. Gateway Computers\nwas going down in flames after opening suburban stores, and Jobs’s argument that his\nwould do better because they would be in more expensive locations was not, on its\nface,  reassuring.  “Think  different”  and  “Here’s  to  the  crazy  ones”  made  for  good\nadvertising slogans, but the board was hesitant to make them guidelines for corporate\nstrategy. “I’m scratching my head and thinking this is crazy,” recalled Art Levinson, the\nCEO of Genentech who joined the Apple board in 2000. “We are a small company, a\nmarginal player. I said that I’m not sure I can support something like this.” Ed Woolard\nwas also dubious. “Gateway has tried this and failed, while Dell is selling direct to\nconsumers without stores and succeeding,” he argued. Jobs was not appreciative of too\nmuch push-back from the board. The last time that happened, he had replaced most of\nthe members. This time, for personal reasons as well as being tired of playing tug-of-\nwar with Jobs, Woolard decided to step down. But before he did, the board approved a\ntrial run of four Apple stores.\nJobs did have one supporter on the board. In 1999 he had recruited the Bronx-born\nretailing prince Millard “Mickey” Drexler, who as CEO of Gap had transformed a\nsleepy chain into an icon of American casual culture. He was one of the few people in\nthe world who were as successful and savvy as Jobs on matters of design, image, and\nconsumer yearnings. In addition, he had insisted on end-to-end control: Gap stores sold\nonly Gap products, and Gap products were sold almost exclusively in Gap stores. “I\nleft the department store business because I couldn’t stand not controlling my own\nproduct, from how it’s manufactured to how it’s sold,” Drexler said. “Steve is just that\nway, which is why I think he recruited me.”\n\nDrexler gave Jobs a piece of advice: Secretly build a prototype of the store near the\nApple campus, furnish it completely, and then hang out there until you feel comfortable\nwith it. So Johnson and Jobs rented a vacant warehouse in Cupertino. Every Tuesday\nfor six months, they convened an all-morning brainstorming session there, refining their\nretailing philosophy as they walked the space. It was the store equivalent of Ive’s\ndesign  studio,  a  haven  where  Jobs,  with  his  visual  approach,  could  come  up  with\ninnovations by touching and seeing the options as they evolved. “I loved to wander over\nthere on my own, just checking it out,” Jobs recalled.\nSometimes he made Drexler, Larry Ellison, and other trusted friends come look. “On\ntoo many weekends, when he wasn’t making me watch new scenes from Toy Story, he\nmade me go to the warehouse and look at the mockups for the store,” Ellison said. “He\nwas obsessed by every detail of the aesthetic and the service experience. It got to the\npoint where I said, ‘Steve I’m not coming to see you if you’re going to make me go to\nthe store again.’”\nEllison’s  company,  Oracle,  was  developing  software  for  the  handheld  checkout\nsystem, which avoided having a cash register counter. On each visit Jobs prodded\nEllison to figure out ways to streamline the process by eliminating some unnecessary\nstep, such as handing over the credit card or printing a receipt. “If you look at the stores\nand  the  products,  you  will  see  Steve’s  obsession  with  beauty  as  simplicity—this\nBauhaus aesthetic and wonderful minimalism, which goes all the way to the checkout\nprocess in the stores,” said Ellison. “It means the absolute minimum number of steps.\nSteve gave us the exact, explicit recipe for how he wanted the checkout to work.”\nWhen Drexler came to see the prototype, he had some criticisms: “I thought the\nspace was too chopped up and not clean enough. There were too many distracting\narchitectural features and colors.” He emphasized that a customer should be able to\nwalk into a retail space and, with one sweep of the eye, understand the flow. Jobs\nagreed that simplicity and lack of distractions were keys to a great store, as they were to\na product. “After that, he nailed it,” said Drexler. “The vision he had was complete\ncontrol of the entire experience of his product, from how it was designed and made to\nhow it was sold.”\nIn October 2000, near what he thought was the end of the process, Johnson woke up\nin the middle of a night before one of the Tuesday meetings with a painful thought: They\nhad gotten something fundamentally wrong. They were organizing the store around each\nof  Apple’s  main  product  lines,  with  areas  for  the  PowerMac,  iMac,  iBook,  and\nPowerBook. But Jobs had begun developing a new concept: the computer as a hub for\nall your digital activity. In other words, your computer might handle video and pictures\nfrom your cameras, and perhaps someday your music player and songs, or your books\nand  magazines.  Johnson’s  predawn  brainstorm  was  that  the  stores  should  organize\ndisplays not just around the company’s four lines of computers, but also around things\npeople might want to do. “For example, I thought there should be a movie bay where\n\nwe’d have various Macs and PowerBooks running iMovie and showing how you can\nimport from your video camera and edit.”\nJohnson arrived at Jobs’s office early that Tuesday and told him about his sudden\ninsight that they needed to reconfigure the stores. He had heard tales of his boss’s\nintemperate tongue, but he had not yet felt its lash—until now. Jobs erupted. “Do you\nknow what a big change this is?” he yelled. “I’ve worked my ass off on this store for six\nmonths, and now you want to change everything!” Jobs suddenly got quiet. “I’m tired. I\ndon’t know if I can design another store from scratch.”\nJohnson was speechless, and Jobs made sure he remained so. On the ride to the\nprototype store, where people had gathered for the Tuesday meeting, he told Johnson not\nto say a word, either to him or to the other members of the team. So the seven-minute\ndrive  proceeded  in  silence.  When  they  arrived,  Jobs  had  finished  processing  the\ninformation. “I knew Ron was right,” he recalled. So to Johnson’s surprise, Jobs opened\nthe meeting by saying, “Ron thinks we’ve got it all wrong. He thinks it should be\norganized not around products but instead around what people do.” There was a pause,\nthen Jobs continued. “And you know, he’s right.” He said they would redo the layout,\neven though it would likely delay the planned January rollout by three or four months.\n“We’ve only got one chance to get it right.”\nJobs  liked  to  tell  the  story—and  he  did  so  to  his  team  that  day—about  how\neverything that he had done correctly had required a moment when he hit the rewind\nbutton. In each case he had to rework something that he discovered was not perfect. He\ntalked about doing it on Toy Story, when the character of Woody had evolved into being\na jerk, and on a couple of occasions with the original Macintosh. “If something isn’t\nright, you can’t just ignore it and say you’ll fix it later,” he said. “That’s what other\ncompanies do.”\nWhen the revised prototype was finally completed in January 2001, Jobs allowed\nthe board to see it for the first time. He explained the theories behind the design by\nsketching on a whiteboard; then he loaded board members into a van for the two-mile\ntrip. When they saw what Jobs and Johnson had built, they unanimously approved going\nahead. It would, the board agreed, take the relationship between retailing and brand\nimage to a new level. It would also ensure that consumers did not see Apple computers\nas merely a commodity product like Dell or Compaq.\nMost outside experts disagreed. “Maybe it’s time Steve Jobs stopped thinking quite\nso differently,” Business Week wrote in a story headlined “Sorry Steve, Here’s Why\nApple Stores Won’t Work.” Apple’s former chief financial officer, Joseph Graziano,\nwas quoted as saying, “Apple’s problem is it still believes the way to grow is serving\ncaviar in a world that seems pretty content with cheese and crackers.” And the retail\nconsultant David Goldstein declared, “I give them two years before they’re turning out\nthe lights on a very painful and expensive mistake.”\n\nWood, Stone, Steel, Glass\nOn  May  19,  2001,  the  first  Apple  store  opened  in  Tyson’s  Corner,  Virginia,  with\ngleaming white counters, bleached wood floors, and a huge “Think Different” poster of\nJohn and Yoko in bed. The skeptics were wrong. Gateway stores had been averaging\n250 visitors a week. By 2004 Apple stores were averaging 5,400 per week. That year\nthe stores had $1.2 billion in revenue, setting a record in the retail industry for reaching\nthe billion-dollar milestone. Sales in each store were tabulated every four minutes by\nEllison’s software, giving instant information on how to integrate manufacturing, supply,\nand sales channels.\nAs the stores flourished, Jobs stayed involved in every aspect. Lee Clow recalled,\n“In one of our marketing meetings just as the stores were opening, Steve made us spend\na half hour deciding what hue of gray the restroom signs should be.” The architectural\nfirm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson designed the signature stores, but Jobs made all of the\nmajor decisions.\nJobs particularly focused on the staircases, which echoed the one he had built at\nNeXT. When he visited a store as it was being constructed, he invariably suggested\nchanges  to  the  staircase.  His  name  is  listed  as  the  lead  inventor  on  two  patent\napplications on the staircases, one for the see-through look that features all-glass treads\nand glass supports melded together with titanium, the other for the engineering system\nthat uses a monolithic unit of glass containing multiple glass sheets laminated together\nfor supporting loads.\nIn 1985, as he was being ousted from his first tour at Apple, he had visited Italy and\nbeen impressed by the gray stone of Florence’s sidewalks. In 2002, when he came to the\nconclusion that the light wood floors in the stores were beginning to look somewhat\npedestrian—a concern that it’s hard to imagine bedeviling someone like Microsoft CEO\nSteve Ballmer—Jobs wanted to use that stone instead. Some of his colleagues pushed to\nreplicate  the  color  and  texture  using  concrete,  which  would  have  been  ten  times\ncheaper,  but  Jobs  insisted  that  it  had  to  be  authentic.  The  gray-blue  Pietra  Serena\nsandstone,  which  has  a  fine-grained  texture,  comes  from  a  family-owned  quarry,  Il\nCasone, in Firenzuola outside of Florence. “We select only 3% of what comes out of the\nmountain, because it has to have the right shading and veining and purity,” said Johnson.\n“Steve felt very strongly that we had to get the color right and it had to be a material\nwith high integrity.” So designers in Florence picked out just the right quarried stone,\noversaw cutting it into the proper tiles, and made sure each tile was marked with a\nsticker to ensure that it was laid out next to its companion tiles. “Knowing that it’s the\nsame stone that Florence uses for its sidewalks assures you that it can stand the test of\ntime,” said Johnson.\nAnother notable feature of the stores was the Genius Bar. Johnson came up with the\nidea on a two-day retreat with his team. He had asked them all to describe the best\n\nservice they’d ever enjoyed. Almost everyone mentioned some nice experience at a\nFour  Seasons  or  Ritz-Carlton  hotel.  So  Johnson  sent  his  first  five  store  managers\nthrough the Ritz-Carlton training program and came up with the idea of replicating\nsomething between a concierge desk and a bar. “What if we staffed the bar with the\nsmartest Mac people,” he said to Jobs. “We could call it the Genius Bar.”\nJobs called the idea crazy. He even objected to the name. “You can’t call them\ngeniuses,” he said. “They’re geeks. They don’t have the people skills to deliver on\nsomething called the genius bar.” Johnson thought he had lost, but the next day he ran\ninto Apple’s general counsel, who said, “By the way, Steve just told me to trademark\nthe name ‘genius bar.’”\nMany of Jobs’s passions came together for Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue store, which\nopened in 2006: a cube, a signature staircase, glass, and making a maximum statement\nthrough  minimalism.  “It  was  really  Steve’s  store,”  said  Johnson.  Open  24/7,  it\nvindicated  the  strategy  of  finding  signature  high-traffic  locations  by  attracting  fifty\nthousand visitors a week during its first year. (Remember Gateway’s draw: 250 visitors\na week.) “This store grosses more per square foot than any store in the world,” Jobs\nproudly noted in 2010. “It also grosses more in total—absolute dollars, not just per\nsquare foot—than any store in New York. That includes Saks and Bloomingdale’s.”\nJobs was able to drum up excitement for store openings with the same flair he used\nfor product releases. People began to travel to store openings and spend the night\noutside so they could be among the first in. “My then 14-year-old son suggested my first\novernighter at Palo Alto, and the experience turned into an interesting social event,”\nwrote Gary Allen, who started a website that caters to Apple store fans. “He and I have\ndone several overnighters, including five in other countries, and have met so many great\npeople.”\nIn July 2011, a decade after the first ones opened, there were 326 Apple stores. The\nbiggest was in London’s Covent Garden, the tallest in Tokyo’s Ginza. The average\nannual revenue per store was $34 million, and the total net sales in fiscal 2010 were\n$9.8 billion. But the stores did even more. They directly accounted for only 15% of\nApple’s revenue, but by creating buzz and brand awareness they indirectly helped boost\neverything the company did.\nEven as he was fighting the effects of cancer in 2011, Jobs spent time envisioning\nfuture store projects, such as the one he wanted to build in New York City’s Grand\nCentral Terminal. One afternoon he showed me a picture of the Fifth Avenue store and\npointed to the eighteen pieces of glass on each side. “This was state of the art in glass\ntechnology at the time,” he said. “We had to build our own autoclaves to make the\nglass.” Then he pulled out a drawing in which the eighteen panes were replaced by four\nhuge panes. That is what he wanted to do next, he said. Once again, it was a challenge at\nthe intersection of aesthetics and technology. “If we wanted to do it with our current\ntechnology, we would have to make the cube a foot shorter,” he said. “And I didn’t want\nto do that. So we have to build some new autoclaves in China.”\n\nRon Johnson was not thrilled by the idea. He thought the eighteen panes actually\nlooked better than four panes would. “The proportions we have today work magically\nwith the colonnade of the GM Building,” he said. “It glitters like a jewel box. I think if\nwe get the glass too transparent, it will almost go away to a fault.” He debated the point\nwith Jobs, but to no avail. “When technology enables something new, he wants to take\nadvantage of that,” said Johnson. “Plus, for Steve, less is always more, simpler is\nalways better. Therefore, if you can build a glass box with fewer elements, it’s better,\nit’s simpler, and it’s at the forefront of technology. That’s where Steve likes to be, in\nboth his products and his stores.”\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY\nTHE DIGITAL HUB\nFrom iTunes to the iPod\nThe original iPod, 2001\nConnecting the Dots\nOnce a year Jobs took his most valuable employees on a retreat, which he called “The\nTop 100.” They were picked based on a simple guideline: the people you would bring\nif you could take only a hundred people with you on a lifeboat to your next company. At\nthe  end  of  each  retreat,  Jobs  would  stand  in  front  of  a  whiteboard  (he  loved\nwhiteboards because they gave him complete control of a situation and they engendered\nfocus) and ask, “What are the ten things we should be doing next?” People would fight\nto get their suggestions on the list. Jobs would write them down, and then cross off the\nones he decreed dumb. After much jockeying, the group would come up with a list of\nten. Then Jobs would slash the bottom seven and announce, “We can only do three.”\n\nBy 2001 Apple had revived its personal computer offerings. It was now time to think\ndifferent. A set of new possibilities topped the what-next list on his whiteboard that\nyear.\nAt the time, a pall had descended on the digital realm. The dot-com bubble had\nburst, and the NASDAQ had fallen more than 50% from its peak. Only three tech\ncompanies had ads during the January 2001 Super Bowl, compared to seventeen the\nyear before. But the sense of deflation went deeper. For the twenty-five years since Jobs\nand Wozniak had founded Apple, the personal computer had been the centerpiece of the\ndigital revolution. Now experts were predicting that its central role was ending. It had\n“matured into something boring,” wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg. Jeff\nWeitzen, the CEO of Gateway, proclaimed, “We’re clearly migrating away from the PC\nas the centerpiece.”\nIt was at that moment that Jobs launched a new grand strategy that would transform\nApple—and with it the entire technology industry. The personal computer, instead of\nedging toward the sidelines, would become a “digital hub” that coordinated a variety of\ndevices, from music players to video recorders to cameras. You’d link and sync all\nthese devices with your computer, and it would manage your music, pictures, video,\ntext, and all aspects of what Jobs dubbed your “digital lifestyle.” Apple would no\nlonger be just a computer company—indeed it would drop that word from its name—\nbut the Macintosh would be reinvigorated by becoming the hub for an astounding array\nof new gadgets, including the iPod and iPhone and iPad.\nWhen he was turning thirty, Jobs had used a metaphor about record albums. He was\nmusing about why folks over thirty develop rigid thought patterns and tend to be less\ninnovative. “People get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they\nnever get out of them,” he said. At age forty-five, Jobs was now about to get out of his\ngroove.\nFireWire\nJobs’s  vision  that  your  computer  could  become  your  digital  hub  went  back  to  a\ntechnology called FireWire, which Apple developed in the early 1990s. It was a high-\nspeed serial port that moved digital files such as video from one device to another.\nJapanese camcorder makers adopted it, and Jobs decided to include it on the updated\nversions of the iMac that came out in October 1999. He began to see that FireWire\ncould be part of a system that moved video from cameras onto a computer, where it\ncould be edited and distributed.\nTo make this work, the iMac needed to have great video editing software. So Jobs\nwent to his old friends at Adobe, the digital graphics company, and asked them to make\na new Mac version of Adobe Premiere, which was popular on Windows computers.\n\nAdobe’s executives stunned Jobs by flatly turning him down. The Macintosh, they said,\nhad too few users to make it worthwhile. Jobs was furious and felt betrayed. “I put\nAdobe on the map, and they screwed me,” he later claimed. Adobe made matters even\nworse when it also didn’t write its other popular programs, such as Photoshop, for the\nMac OSX, even though the Macintosh was popular among designers and other creative\npeople who used those applications.\nJobs never forgave Adobe, and a decade later he got into a public war with the\ncompany by not permitting Adobe Flash to run on the iPad. He took away a valuable\nlesson that reinforced his desire for end-to-end control of all key elements of a system:\n“My primary insight when we were screwed by Adobe in 1999 was that we shouldn’t\nget into any business where we didn’t control both the hardware and the software,\notherwise we’d get our head handed to us.”\nSo starting in 1999 Apple began to produce application software for the Mac, with a\nfocus on people at the intersection of art and technology. These included Final Cut Pro,\nfor editing digital video; iMovie, which was a simpler consumer version; iDVD, for\nburning  video  or  music  onto  a  disc;  iPhoto,  to  compete  with  Adobe  Photoshop;\nGarageBand, for creating and mixing music; iTunes, for managing your songs; and the\niTunes Store, for buying songs.\nThe idea of the digital hub quickly came into focus. “I first understood this with the\ncamcorder,” Jobs said. “Using iMovie makes your camcorder ten times more valuable.”\nInstead of having hundreds of hours of raw footage you would never really sit through,\nyou could edit it on your computer, make elegant dissolves, add music, and roll credits,\nlisting yourself as executive producer. It allowed people to be creative, to express\nthemselves,  to  make  something  emotional.  “That’s  when  it  hit  me  that  the  personal\ncomputer was going to morph into something else.”\nJobs had another insight: If the computer served as the hub, it would allow the\nportable devices to become simpler. A lot of the functions that the devices tried to do,\nsuch as editing the video or pictures, they did poorly because they had small screens\nand could not easily accommodate menus filled with lots of functions. Computers could\nhandle that more easily.\nAnd  one  more  thing  ...  What  Jobs  also  saw  was  that  this  worked  best  when\neverything—the device, computer, software, applications, FireWire—was all tightly\nintegrated. “I became even more of a believer in providing end-to-end solutions,” he\nrecalled.\nThe beauty of this realization was that there was only one company that was well-\npositioned to provide such an integrated approach. Microsoft wrote software, Dell and\nCompaq made hardware, Sony produced a lot of digital devices, Adobe developed a lot\nof applications. But only Apple did all of these things. “We’re the only company that\nowns the whole widget—the hardware, the software and the operating system,” he\nexplained to Time. “We can take full responsibility for the user experience. We can do\nthings that the other guys can’t do.”\n\nApple’s first integrated foray into the digital hub strategy was video. With FireWire,\nyou could get your video onto your Mac, and with iMovie you could edit it into a\nmasterpiece. Then what? You’d want to burn some DVDs so you and your friends could\nwatch it on a TV. “So we spent a lot of time working with the drive manufacturers to get\na consumer drive that could burn a DVD,” he said. “We were the first to ever ship that.”\nAs usual Jobs focused on making the product as simple as possible for the user, and this\nwas the key to its success. Mike Evangelist, who worked at Apple on software design,\nrecalled demonstrating to Jobs an early version of the interface. After looking at a bunch\nof screenshots, Jobs jumped up, grabbed a marker, and drew a simple rectangle on a\nwhiteboard. “Here’s the new application,” he said. “It’s got one window. You drag your\nvideo into the window. Then you click the button that says ‘Burn.’ That’s it. That’s what\nwe’re going to make.” Evangelist was dumbfounded, but it led to the simplicity of what\nbecame iDVD. Jobs even helped design the “Burn” button icon.\nJobs knew digital photography was also about to explode, so Apple developed ways\nto make the computer the hub of your photos. But for the first year at least, he took his\neye off one really big opportunity. HP and a few others were producing a drive that\nburned music CDs, but Jobs decreed that Apple should focus on video rather than\nmusic. In addition, his angry insistence that the iMac get rid of its tray disk drive and\nuse instead a more elegant slot drive meant that it could not include the first CD burners,\nwhich were initially made for the tray format. “We kind of missed the boat on that,” he\nrecalled. “So we needed to catch up real fast.”\nThe mark of an innovative company is not only that it comes up with new ideas first,\nbut also that it knows how to leapfrog when it finds itself behind.\niTunes\nIt didn’t take Jobs long to realize that music was going to be huge. By 2000 people were\nripping  music  onto  their  computers  from  CDs,  or  downloading  it  from  file-sharing\nservices such as Napster, and burning playlists onto their own blank disks. That year the\nnumber of blank CDs sold in the United States was 320 million. There were only 281\nmillion people in the country. That meant some people were really into burning CDs,\nand Apple wasn’t catering to them. “I felt like a dope,” he told Fortune. “I thought we\nhad missed it. We had to work hard to catch up.”\nJobs added a CD burner to the iMac, but that wasn’t enough. His goal was to make it\nsimple to transfer music from a CD, manage it on your computer, and then burn playlists.\nOther companies were already making music-management applications, but they were\nclunky and complex. One of Jobs’s talents was spotting markets that were filled with\nsecond-rate products. He looked at the music apps that were available—including Real\nJukebox, Windows Media Player, and one that HP was including with its CD burner—\n\nand came to a conclusion: “They were so complicated that only a genius could figure\nout half of their features.”\nThat is when Bill Kincaid came in. A former Apple software engineer, he was\ndriving to the Willow Springs track in California, to race his Formula Ford sports car\nwhile (a bit incongruously) listening to National Public Radio. He heard a report about\na portable music player called the Rio that played a digital song format called MP3. He\nperked  up  when  the  reporter  said  something  like,  “Don’t  get  excited,  Mac  users,\nbecause it won’t work with Macs.” Kincaid said to himself, “Ha! I can fix that!”\nTo help him write a Rio manager for the Mac, he called his friends Jeff Robbin and\nDave  Heller,  also  former  Apple  software  engineers.  Their  product,  known  as\nSoundJam, offered Mac users an interface for the Rio and software for managing the\nsongs on their computer. In July 2000, when Jobs was pushing his team to come up with\nmusic-management  software,  Apple  swooped  in  and  bought  SoundJam,  bringing  its\nfounders back into the Apple fold. (All three stayed with the company, and Robbin\ncontinued  to  run  the  music  software  development  team  for  the  next  decade.  Jobs\nconsidered Robbin so valuable he once allowed a Time reporter to meet him only after\nextracting the promise that the reporter would not print his last name.)\nJobs personally worked with them to transform SoundJam into an Apple product. It\nwas laden with all sorts of features, and consequently a lot of complex screens. Jobs\npushed them to make it simpler and more fun. Instead of an interface that made you\nspecify whether you were searching for an artist, song, or album, Jobs insisted on a\nsimple  box  where  you  could  type  in  anything  you  wanted.  From  iMovie  the  team\nadopted the sleek brushed-metal look and also a name. They dubbed it iTunes.\nJobs  unveiled  iTunes  at  the  January  2001  Macworld  as  part  of  the  digital  hub\nstrategy. It would be free to all Mac users, he announced. “Join the music revolution\nwith iTunes, and make your music devices ten times more valuable,” he concluded to\ngreat applause. As his advertising slogan would later put it: Rip. Mix. Burn.\nThat afternoon Jobs happened to be meeting with John Markoff of the New  York\nTimes. The interview was going badly, but at the end Jobs sat down at his Mac and\nshowed off iTunes. “It reminds me of my youth,” he said as the psychedelic patterns\ndanced on the screen. That led him to reminisce about dropping acid. Taking LSD was\none of the two or three most important things he’d done in his life, Jobs told Markoff.\nPeople who had never taken acid would never fully understand him.\nThe iPod\nThe next step for the digital hub strategy was to make a portable music player. Jobs\nrealized that Apple had the opportunity to design such a device in tandem with the\niTunes software, allowing it to be simpler. Complex tasks could be handled on the\n\ncomputer, easy ones on the device. Thus was born the iPod, the device that would begin\nthe transformation of Apple from being a computer maker into being the world’s most\nvaluable company.\nJobs  had  a  special  passion  for  the  project  because  he  loved  music.  The  music\nplayers that were already on the market, he told his colleagues, “truly sucked.” Phil\nSchiller, Jon Rubinstein, and the rest of the team agreed. As they were building iTunes,\nthey spent time with the Rio and other players while merrily trashing them. “We would\nsit around and say, ‘These things really stink,’” Schiller recalled. “They held about\nsixteen songs, and you couldn’t figure out how to use them.”\nJobs began pushing for a portable music player in the fall of 2000, but Rubinstein\nresponded that the necessary components were not available yet. He asked Jobs to wait.\nAfter a few months Rubinstein was able to score a suitable small LCD screen and\nrechargeable lithium-polymer battery. The tougher challenge was finding a disk drive\nthat was small enough but had ample memory to make a great music player. Then, in\nFebruary 2001, he took one of his regular trips to Japan to visit Apple’s suppliers.\nAt the end of a routine meeting with Toshiba, the engineers mentioned a new product\nthey had in the lab that would be ready by that June. It was a tiny, 1.8-inch drive (the\nsize of a silver dollar) that would hold five gigabytes of storage (about a thousand\nsongs), and they were not sure what to do with it. When the Toshiba engineers showed it\nto Rubinstein, he knew immediately what it could be used for. A thousand songs in his\npocket! Perfect. But he kept a poker face. Jobs was also in Japan, giving the keynote\nspeech at the Tokyo Macworld conference. They met that night at the Hotel Okura,\nwhere Jobs was staying. “I know how to do it now,” Rubinstein told him. “All I need is\na $10 million check.” Jobs immediately authorized it. So Rubinstein started negotiating\nwith Toshiba to have exclusive rights to every one of the disks it could make, and he\nbegan to look around for someone who could lead the development team.\nTony Fadell was a brash entrepreneurial programmer with a cyberpunk look and an\nengaging  smile  who  had  started  three  companies  while  still  at  the  University  of\nMichigan. He had gone to work at the handheld device maker General Magic (where he\nmet Apple refugees Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson), and then spent some awkward\ntime at Philips Electronics, where he bucked the staid culture with his short bleached\nhair and rebellious style. He had come up with some ideas for creating a better digital\nmusic player, which he had shopped around unsuccessfully to RealNetworks, Sony, and\nPhilips. One day he was in Colorado, skiing with an uncle, and his cell phone rang\nwhile he was riding on the chairlift. It was Rubinstein, who told him that Apple was\nlooking  for  someone  who  could  work  on  a  “small  electronic  device.”  Fadell,  not\nlacking in confidence, boasted that he was a wizard at making such devices. Rubinstein\ninvited him to Cupertino.\nFadell assumed that he was being hired to work on a personal digital assistant, some\nsuccessor to the Newton. But when he met with Rubinstein, the topic quickly turned to\niTunes, which had been out for three months. “We’ve been trying to hook up the existing\n\nMP3 players to iTunes and they’ve been horrible, absolutely horrible,” Rubinstein told\nhim. “We think we should make our own version.”\nFadell was thrilled. “I was passionate about music. I was trying to do some of that at\nRealNetworks, and I was pitching an MP3 player to Palm.” He agreed to come aboard,\nat least as a consultant. After a few weeks Rubinstein insisted that if he was to lead the\nteam, he had to become a full-time Apple employee. But Fadell resisted; he liked his\nfreedom. Rubinstein was furious at what he considered Fadell’s whining. “This is one\nof those life decisions,” he told Fadell. “You’ll never regret it.”\nHe decided to force Fadell’s hand. He gathered a roomful of the twenty or so people\nwho had been assigned to the project. When Fadell walked in, Rubinstein told him,\n“Tony, we’re not doing this project unless you sign on full-time. Are you in or out? You\nhave to decide right now.”\nFadell looked Rubinstein in the eye, then turned to the audience and said, “Does this\nalways happen at Apple, that people are put under duress to sign an offer?” He paused\nfor a moment, said yes, and grudgingly shook Rubinstein’s hand. “It left some very\nunsettling feeling between Jon and me for many years,” Fadell recalled. Rubinstein\nagreed: “I don’t think he ever forgave me for that.”\nFadell and Rubinstein were fated to clash because they both thought that they had\nfathered the iPod. As Rubinstein saw it, he had been given the mission by Jobs months\nearlier, found the Toshiba disk drive, and figured out the screen, battery, and other key\nelements. He had then brought in Fadell to put it together. He and others who resented\nFadell’s  visibility  began  to  refer  to  him  as  “Tony  Baloney.”  But  from  Fadell’s\nperspective, before he came to Apple he had already come up with plans for a great\nMP3 player, and he had been shopping it around to other companies before he had\nagreed to come to Apple. The issue of who deserved the most credit for the iPod, or\nshould get the title Podfather, would be fought over the years in interviews, articles,\nweb pages, and even Wikipedia entries.\nBut for the next few months they were too busy to bicker. Jobs wanted the iPod out\nby Christmas, and this meant having it ready to unveil in October. They looked around\nfor other companies that were designing MP3 players that could serve as the foundation\nfor Apple’s work and settled on a small company named PortalPlayer. Fadell told the\nteam there, “This is the project that’s going to remold Apple, and ten years from now,\nit’s going to be a music business, not a computer business.” He convinced them to sign\nan exclusive deal, and his group began to modify PortalPlayer’s deficiencies, such as its\ncomplex interfaces, short battery life, and inability to make a playlist longer than ten\nsongs.\nThat’s It!\n\nThere  are  certain  meetings  that  are  memorable  both  because  they  mark  a  historic\nmoment and because they illuminate the way a leader operates. Such was the case with\nthe  gathering  in  Apple’s  fourth-floor  conference  room  in  April  2001,  where  Jobs\ndecided on the fundamentals of the iPod. There to hear Fadell present his proposals to\nJobs were Rubinstein, Schiller, Ive, Jeff Robbin, and marketing director Stan Ng. Fadell\ndidn’t know Jobs, and he was understandably intimidated. “When he walked into the\nconference room, I sat up and thought, ‘Whoa, there’s Steve!’ I was really on guard,\nbecause I’d heard how brutal he could be.”\nThe  meeting  started  with  a  presentation  of  the  potential  market  and  what  other\ncompanies were doing. Jobs, as usual, had no patience. “He won’t pay attention to a\nslide deck for more than a minute,” Fadell said.\nWhen a slide showed other possible players in the market, he waved it away. “Don’t\nworry about Sony,” he said. “We know what we’re doing, and they don’t.” After that,\nthey quit showing slides, and instead Jobs peppered the group with questions. Fadell\ntook away a lesson: “Steve prefers to be in the moment, talking things through. He once\ntold me, ‘If you need slides, it shows you don’t know what you’re talking about.’”\nInstead Jobs liked to be shown physical objects that he could feel, inspect, and\nfondle. So Fadell brought three different models to the conference room; Rubinstein had\ncoached him on how to reveal them sequentially so that his preferred choice would be\nthe pièce de résistance. They hid the mockup of that option under a wooden bowl at the\ncenter of the table.\nFadell began his show-and-tell by taking the various parts they were using out of a\nbox  and  spreading  them  on  the  table.  There  were  the  1.8-inch  drive,  LCD  screen,\nboards, and batteries, all labeled with their cost and weight. As he displayed them, they\ndiscussed how the prices or sizes might come down over the next year or so. Some of\nthe pieces could be put together, like Lego blocks, to show the options.\nThen Fadell began unveiling his models, which were made of Styrofoam with fishing\nleads inserted to give them the proper weight. The first had a slot for a removable\nmemory card for music. Jobs dismissed it as complicated. The second had dynamic\nRAM memory, which was cheap but would lose all of the songs if the battery ran out.\nJobs was not pleased. Next Fadell put a few of the pieces together to show what a\ndevice with the 1.8-inch hard drive would be like. Jobs seemed intrigued. The show\nclimaxed with Fadell lifting the bowl and revealing a fully assembled model of that\nalternative. “I was hoping to be able to play more with the Lego parts, but Steve settled\nright on the hard-drive option just the way we had modeled it,” Fadell recalled. He was\nrather stunned by the process. “I was used to being at Philips, where decisions like this\nwould take meeting after meeting, with a lot of PowerPoint presentations and going\nback for more study.”\nNext it was Phil Schiller’s turn. “Can I bring out my idea now?” he asked. He left\nthe room and returned with a handful of iPod models, all of which had the same device\non the front: the soon-to-be-famous trackwheel. “I had been thinking of how you go\n\nthrough a playlist,” he recalled. “You can’t press a button hundreds of times. Wouldn’t it\nbe great if you could have a wheel?” By turning the wheel with your thumb, you could\nscroll through songs. The longer you kept turning, the faster the scrolling got, so you\ncould zip through hundreds easily. Jobs shouted, “That’s it!” He got Fadell and the\nengineers working on it.\nOnce the project was launched, Jobs immersed himself in it daily. His main demand\nwas “Simplify!” He would go over each screen of the user interface and apply a rigid\ntest: If he wanted a song or a function, he should be able to get there in three clicks. And\nthe click should be intuitive. If he couldn’t figure out how to navigate to something, or if\nit took more than three clicks, he would be brutal. “There would be times when we’d\nrack our brains on a user interface problem, and think we’d considered every option,\nand he would go, ‘Did you think of this?’” said Fadell. “And then we’d all go, ‘Holy\nshit.’ He’d redefine the problem or approach, and our little problem would go away.”\nEvery night Jobs would be on the phone with ideas. Fadell and the others would call\neach other up, discuss Jobs’s latest suggestion, and conspire on how to nudge him to\nwhere they wanted him to go, which worked about half the time. “We would have this\nswirling thing of Steve’s latest idea, and we would all try to stay ahead of it,” said\nFadell. “Every day there was something like that, whether it was a switch here, or a\nbutton color, or a pricing strategy issue. With his style, you needed to work with your\npeers, watch each other’s back.”\nOne  key  insight  Jobs  had  was  that  as  many  functions  as  possible  should  be\nperformed using iTunes on your computer rather than on the iPod. As he later recalled:\nIn order to make the iPod really easy to use—and this took a lot of arguing on my part—\nwe needed to limit what the device itself would do. Instead we put that functionality in\niTunes on the computer. For example, we made it so you couldn’t make playlists using\nthe device. You made playlists on iTunes, and then you synced with the device. That\nwas controversial. But what made the Rio and other devices so brain-dead was that\nthey were complicated. They had to do things like make playlists, because they weren’t\nintegrated  with  the  jukebox  software  on  your  computer.  So  by  owning  the  iTunes\nsoftware and the iPod device, that allowed us to make the computer and the device\nwork together, and it allowed us to put the complexity in the right place.\nThe most Zen of all simplicities was Jobs’s decree, which astonished his colleagues,\nthat the iPod would not have an on-off switch. It became true of most Apple devices.\nThere was no need for one. Apple’s devices would go dormant if they were not being\nused, and they would wake up when you touched any key. But there was no need for a\nswitch that would go “Click—you’re off. Good-bye.”\n\nSuddenly everything had fallen into place: a drive that would hold a thousand songs;\nan interface and scroll wheel that would let you navigate a thousand songs; a FireWire\nconnection that could sync a thousand songs in under ten minutes; and a battery that\nwould last through a thousand songs. “We suddenly were looking at one another and\nsaying, ‘This is going to be so cool,’” Jobs recalled. “We knew how cool it was,\nbecause we knew how badly we each wanted one personally. And the concept became\nso  beautifully  simple:  a  thousand  songs  in  your  pocket.”  One  of  the  copywriters\nsuggested they call it a “Pod.” Jobs was the one who, borrowing from the iMac and\niTunes names, modified that to iPod.\nThe Whiteness of the Whale\nJony Ive had been playing with the foam model of the iPod and trying to conceive what\nthe finished product should look like when an idea occurred to him on a morning drive\nfrom his San Francisco home to Cupertino. Its face should be pure white, he told his\ncolleague in the car, and it should connect seamlessly to a polished stainless steel back.\n“Most small consumer products have this disposable feel to them,” said Ive. “There is\nno cultural gravity to them. The thing I’m proudest of about the iPod is that there is\nsomething about it that makes it feel significant, not disposable.”\nThe white would be not just white, but pure white. “Not only the device, but the\nheadphones and the wires and even the power block,” he recalled. “Pure white.” Others\nkept arguing that the headphones, of course, should be black, like all headphones. “But\nSteve got it immediately, and embraced white,” said Ive. “There would be a purity to\nit.” The sinuous flow of the white earbud wires helped make the iPod an icon. As Ive\ndescribed it:\nThere was something very significant and nondisposable about it, yet there was also\nsomething very quiet and very restrained. It wasn’t wagging its tail in your face. It was\nrestrained, but it was also crazy, with those flowing headphones. That’s why I like\nwhite. White isn’t just a neutral color. It is so pure and quiet. Bold and conspicuous and\nyet so inconspicuous as well.\nLee Clow’s advertising team at TBWA\\Chiat\\Day wanted to celebrate the iconic nature\nof the iPod and its whiteness rather than create more traditional product-introduction\nads that showed off the device’s features. James Vincent, a lanky young Brit who had\nplayed in a band and worked as a DJ, had recently joined the agency, and he was a\nnatural to help focus Apple’s advertising on hip millennial-generation music lovers\n\nrather than rebel baby boomers. With the help of the art director Susan Alinsangan, they\ncreated a series of billboards and posters for the iPod, and they spread the options on\nJobs’s conference room table for his inspection.\nAt  the  far  right  end  they  placed  the  most  traditional  options,  which  featured\nstraightforward photos of the iPod on a white background. At the far left end they\nplaced  the  most  graphic  and  iconic  treatments,  which  showed  just  a  silhouette  of\nsomeone dancing while listening to an iPod, its white earphone wires waving with the\nmusic.  “It  understood  your  emotional  and  intensely  personal  relationship  with  the\nmusic,” Vincent said. He suggested to Duncan Milner, the creative director, that they all\nstand firmly at the far left end, to see if they could get Jobs to gravitate there. When he\nwalked in, he went immediately to the right, looking at the stark product pictures. “This\nlooks great,” he said. “Let’s talk about these.” Vincent, Milner, and Clow did not budge\nfrom the other end. Finally, Jobs looked up, glanced at the iconic treatments, and said,\n“Oh, I guess you like this stuff.” He shook his head. “It doesn’t show the product. It\ndoesn’t say what it is.” Vincent proposed that they use the iconic images but add the\ntagline, “1,000 songs in your pocket.” That would say it all. Jobs glanced back toward\nthe right end of the table, then finally agreed. Not surprisingly he was soon claiming that\nit was his idea to push for the more iconic ads. “There were some skeptics around who\nasked, ‘How’s this going to actually sell an iPod?’” Jobs recalled. “That’s when it came\nin handy to be the CEO, so I could push the idea through.”\nJobs realized that there was yet another advantage to the fact that Apple had an\nintegrated system of computer, software, and device. It meant that sales of the iPod\nwould drive sales of the iMac. That, in turn, meant that he could take money that Apple\nwas  spending  on  iMac  advertising  and  shift  it  to  spending  on  iPod  ads—getting  a\ndouble bang for the buck. A triple bang, actually, because the ads would lend luster and\nyouthfulness to the whole Apple brand. He recalled:\nI had this crazy idea that we could sell just as many Macs by advertising the iPod. In\naddition, the iPod would position Apple as evoking innovation and youth. So I moved\n$75 million of advertising money to the iPod, even though the category didn’t justify one\nhundredth  of  that.  That  meant  that  we  completely  dominated  the  market  for  music\nplayers. We outspent everybody by a factor of about a hundred.\nThe television ads showed the iconic silhouettes dancing to songs picked by Jobs,\nClow, and Vincent. “Finding the music became our main fun at our weekly marketing\nmeetings,” said Clow. “We’d play some edgy cut, Steve would say, ‘I hate that,’ and\nJames would have to talk him into it.” The ads helped popularize many new bands, most\nnotably the Black Eyed Peas; the ad with “Hey Mama” is the classic of the silhouettes\ngenre. When a new ad was about to go into production, Jobs would often have second\n\nthoughts, call up Vincent, and insist that he cancel it. “It sounds a bit poppy” or “It\nsounds a bit trivial,” he would say. “Let’s call it off.” James would get flustered and try\nto talk him around. “Hold on, it’s going to be great,” he would argue. Invariably Jobs\nwould relent, the ad would be made, and he would love it.\nJobs unveiled the iPod on October 23, 2001, at one of his signature product launch\nevents. “Hint: It’s not a Mac,” the invitation teased. When it came time to reveal the\nproduct, after he described its technical capabilities, Jobs did not do his usual trick of\nwalking over to a table and pulling off a velvet cloth. Instead he said, “I happen to have\none right here in my pocket.” He reached into his jeans and pulled out the gleaming\nwhite device. “This amazing little device holds a thousand songs, and it goes right in my\npocket.” He slipped it back in and ambled offstage to applause.\nInitially there was some skepticism among tech geeks, especially about the $399\nprice. In the blogosphere, the joke was that iPod stood for “idiots price our devices.”\nHowever, consumers soon made it a hit. More than that, the iPod became the essence of\neverything  Apple  was  destined  to  be:  poetry  connected  to  engineering,  arts  and\ncreativity intersecting with technology, design that’s bold and simple. It had an ease of\nuse that came from being an integrated end-to-end system, from computer to FireWire to\ndevice to software to content management. When you took an iPod out of the box, it was\nso beautiful that it seemed to glow, and it made all other music players look as if they\nhad been designed and manufactured in Uzbekistan.\nNot since the original Mac had a clarity of product vision so propelled a company\ninto the future. “If anybody was ever wondering why Apple is on the earth, I would hold\nup this as a good example,” Jobs told Newsweek’s Steve Levy at the time. Wozniak,\nwho had long been skeptical of integrated systems, began to revise his philosophy.\n“Wow, it makes sense that Apple was the one to come up with it,” Wozniak enthused\nafter the iPod came out. “After all, Apple’s whole history is making both the hardware\nand the software, with the result that the two work better together.”\nThe day that Levy got his press preview of the iPod, he happened to be meeting Bill\nGates at a dinner, and he showed it to him. “Have you seen this yet?” Levy asked. Levy\nnoted, “Gates went into a zone that recalls those science fiction films where a space\nalien, confronted with a novel object, creates some sort of force tunnel between him and\nthe object, allowing him to suck directly into his brain all possible information about\nit.” Gates played with the scroll wheel and pushed every button combination, while his\neyes stared fixedly at the screen. “It looks like a great product,” he finally said. Then he\npaused and looked puzzled. “It’s only for Macintosh?” he asked.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nTHE iTUNES STORE\nI’m the Pied Piper\nWarner Music\nAt the beginning of 2002 Apple faced a challenge. The seamless connection between\nyour iPod, iTunes software, and computer made it easy to manage the music you already\nowned. But to get new music, you had to venture out of this cozy environment and go\nbuy a CD or download the songs online. The latter endeavor usually meant foraying into\nthe murky domains of file-sharing and piracy services. So Jobs wanted to offer iPod\nusers a way to download songs that was simple, safe, and legal.\nThe music industry also faced a challenge. It was being plagued by a bestiary of\npiracy services—Napster, Grokster, Gnutella, Kazaa—that enabled people to get songs\nfor free. Partly as a result, legal sales of CDs were down 9% in 2002.\nThe  executives  at  the  music  companies  were  desperately  scrambling,  with  the\nelegance of second-graders playing soccer, to agree on a common standard for copy-\nprotecting digital music. Paul Vidich of Warner Music and his corporate colleague Bill\nRaduchel of AOL Time Warner were working with Sony in that effort, and they hoped to\nget Apple to be part of their consortium. So a group of them flew to Cupertino in\nJanuary 2002 to see Jobs.\nIt was not an easy meeting. Vidich had a cold and was losing his voice, so his\ndeputy, Kevin Gage, began the presentation. Jobs, sitting at the head of the conference\ntable, fidgeted and looked annoyed. After four slides, he waved his hand and broke in.\n“You have your heads up your asses,” he pointed out. Everyone turned to Vidich, who\nstruggled to get his voice working. “You’re right,” he said after a long pause. “We don’t\nknow what to do. You need to help us figure it out.” Jobs later recalled being slightly\ntaken aback, and he agreed that Apple would work with the Warner-Sony effort.\n\nIf the music companies had been able to agree on a standardized encoding method\nfor protecting music files, then multiple online stores could have proliferated. That\nwould have made it hard for Jobs to create an iTunes Store that allowed Apple to\ncontrol how online sales were handled. Sony, however, handed Jobs that opportunity\nwhen it decided, after the January 2002 Cupertino meeting, to pull out of the talks\nbecause it favored its own proprietary format, from which it would get royalties.\n“You know Steve, he has his own agenda,” Sony’s CEO Nobuyuki Idei explained to\nRed Herring editor Tony Perkins. “Although he is a genius, he doesn’t share everything\nwith you. This is a difficult person to work with if you are a big company.... It is a\nnightmare.” Howard Stringer, then head of Sony North America, added about Jobs:\n“Trying to get together would frankly be a waste of time.”\nInstead Sony joined with Universal to create a subscription service called Pressplay.\nMeanwhile, AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann, and EMI teamed up with RealNetworks to\ncreate MusicNet. Neither would license its songs to the rival service, so each offered\nonly  about  half  the  music  available.  Both  were  subscription  services  that  allowed\ncustomers  to  stream  songs  but  not  keep  them,  so  you  lost  access  to  them  if  your\nsubscription lapsed. They had complicated restrictions and clunky interfaces. Indeed\nthey would earn the dubious distinction of becoming number nine on PC World’s list of\n“the  25  worst  tech  products  of  all  time.”  The  magazine  declared,  “The  services’\nstunningly brain-dead features showed that the record companies still didn’t get it.”\nAt this point Jobs could have decided simply to indulge piracy. Free music meant more\nvaluable iPods. Yet because he really liked music, and the artists who made it, he was\nopposed to what he saw as the theft of creative products. As he later told me:\nFrom the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created intellectual\nproperty. If people copied or stole our software, we’d be out of business. If it weren’t\nprotected, there’d be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs. If\nprotection  of  intellectual  property  begins  to  disappear,  creative  companies  will\ndisappear or never get started. But there’s a simpler reason: It’s wrong to steal. It hurts\nother people. And it hurts your own character.\nHe knew, however, that the best way to stop piracy—in fact the only way—was to offer\nan  alternative  that  was  more  attractive  than  the  brain-dead  services  that  music\ncompanies were concocting. “We believe that 80% of the people stealing stuff don’t\nwant to be, there’s just no legal alternative,” he told Andy Langer of Esquire. “So we\nsaid, ‘Let’s create a legal alternative to this.’ Everybody wins. Music companies win.\n\nThe artists win. Apple wins. And the user wins, because he gets a better service and\ndoesn’t have to be a thief.”\nSo Jobs set out to create an “iTunes Store” and to persuade the five top record\ncompanies to allow digital versions of their songs to be sold there. “I’ve never spent so\nmuch of my time trying to convince people to do the right thing for themselves,” he\nrecalled. Because the companies were worried about the pricing model and unbundling\nof albums, Jobs pitched that his new service would be only on the Macintosh, a mere\n5% of the market. They could try the idea with little risk. “We used our small market\nshare  to  our  advantage  by  arguing  that  if  the  store  turned  out  to  be  destructive  it\nwouldn’t destroy the entire universe,” he recalled.\nJobs’s proposal was to sell digital songs for 99 cents—a simple and impulsive\npurchase. The record companies would get 70 cents of that. Jobs insisted that this\nwould be more appealing than the monthly subscription model preferred by the music\ncompanies. He believed that people had an emotional connection to the songs they\nloved. They wanted to own “Sympathy for the Devil” and “Shelter from the Storm,” not\njust rent them. As he told Jeff Goodell of Rolling Stone at the time, “I think you could\nmake  available  the  Second  Coming  in  a  subscription  model  and  it  might  not  be\nsuccessful.”\nJobs also insisted that the iTunes Store would sell individual songs, not just entire\nalbums. That ended up being the biggest cause of conflict with the record companies,\nwhich made money by putting out albums that had two or three great songs and a dozen\nor so fillers; to get the\nsong they wanted, consumers had to buy the whole album. Some musicians objected\non artistic grounds to Jobs’s plan to disaggregate albums. “There’s a flow to a good\nalbum,” said Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. “The songs support each other. That’s the\nway I like to make music.” But the objections were moot. “Piracy and online downloads\nhad  already  deconstructed  the  album,”  recalled  Jobs.  “You  couldn’t  compete  with\npiracy unless you sold the songs individually.”\nAt the heart of the problem was a chasm between the people who loved technology\nand those who loved artistry. Jobs loved both, as he had demonstrated at Pixar and\nApple, and he was thus positioned to bridge the gap. He later explained:\nWhen  I  went  to  Pixar,  I  became  aware  of  a  great  divide.  Tech  companies  don’t\nunderstand creativity. They don’t appreciate intuitive thinking, like the ability of an\nA&R guy at a music label to listen to a hundred artists and have a feel for which five\nmight be successful. And they think that creative people just sit around on couches all\nday and are undisciplined, because they’ve not seen how driven and disciplined the\ncreative  folks  at  places  like  Pixar  are.  On  the  other  hand,  music  companies  are\ncompletely clueless about technology. They think they can just go out and hire a few tech\nfolks. But that would be like Apple trying to hire people to produce music. We’d get\n\nsecond-rate A&R people, just like the music companies ended up with second-rate tech\npeople. I’m one of the few people who understands how producing technology requires\nintuition and creativity, and how producing something artistic takes real discipline.\nJobs had a long relationship with Barry Schuler, the CEO of the AOL unit of Time\nWarner, and began to pick his brain about how to get the music labels into the proposed\niTunes Store. “Piracy is flipping everyone’s circuit breakers,” Schuler told him. “You\nshould use the argument that because you have an integrated end-to-end service, from\niPods to the store, you can best protect how the music is used.”\nOne day in March 2002, Schuler got a call from Jobs and decided to conference-in\nVidich. Jobs asked Vidich if he would come to Cupertino and bring the head of Warner\nMusic, Roger Ames. This time Jobs was charming. Ames was a sardonic, fun, and\nclever Brit, a type (such as James Vincent and Jony Ive) that Jobs tended to like. So the\nGood Steve was on display. At one point early in the meeting, Jobs even played the\nunusual role of diplomat. Ames and Eddy Cue, who ran iTunes for Apple, got into an\nargument over why radio in England was not as vibrant as in the United States, and Jobs\nstepped in, saying, “We know about tech, but we don’t know as much about music, so\nlet’s not argue.”\nAmes  had  just  lost  a  boardroom  battle  to  have  his  corporation’s  AOL  division\nimprove its own fledgling music download service. “When I did a digital download\nusing AOL, I could never find the song on my shitty computer,” he recalled. So when\nJobs demonstrated a prototype of the iTunes Store, Ames was impressed. “Yes, yes,\nthat’s exactly what we’ve been waiting for,” he said. He agreed that Warner Music\nwould sign up, and he offered to help enlist other music companies.\nJobs flew east to show the service to other Time Warner execs. “He sat in front of a\nMac like a kid with a toy,” Vidich recalled. “Unlike any other CEO, he was totally\nengaged with the product.” Ames and Jobs began to hammer out the details of the iTunes\nStore, including the number of times a track could be put on different devices and how\nthe copy-protection system would work. They soon were in agreement and set out to\ncorral other music labels.\nHerding Cats\nThe key player to enlist was Doug Morris, head of the Universal Music Group. His\ndomain included must-have artists such as U2, Eminem, and Mariah Carey, as well as\npowerful labels such as Motown and Interscope-Geffen-A&M. Morris was eager to\ntalk. More than any other mogul, he was upset about piracy and fed up with the caliber\nof the technology people at the music companies. “It was like the Wild West,” Morris\n\nrecalled. “No one was selling digital music, and it was awash with piracy. Everything\nwe tried at the record companies was a failure. The difference in skill sets between the\nmusic folks and technologists is just huge.”\nAs Ames walked with Jobs to Morris’s office on Broadway he briefed Jobs on what\nto say. It worked. What impressed Morris was that Jobs tied everything together in a\nway that made things easy for the consumer and also safe for the record companies.\n“Steve did something brilliant,” said Morris. “He proposed this complete system: the\niTunes Store, the music-management software, the iPod itself. It was so smooth. He had\nthe whole package.”\nMorris was convinced that Jobs had the technical vision that was lacking at the\nmusic companies. “Of course we have to rely on Steve Jobs to do this,” he told his own\ntech vice president, “because we don’t have anyone at Universal who knows anything\nabout technology.” That did not make Universal’s technologists eager to work with\nJobs, and Morris had to keep ordering them to surrender their objections and make a\ndeal quickly. They were able to add a few more restrictions to FairPlay, the Apple\nsystem of digital rights management, so that a purchased song could not be spread to too\nmany devices. But in general, they went along with the concept of the iTunes Store that\nJobs had worked out with Ames and his Warner colleagues.\nMorris was so smitten with Jobs that he called Jimmy Iovine, the fast-talking and\nbrash chief of Interscope-Geffen-A&M. Iovine and Morris were best friends who had\nspoken every day for the past thirty years. “When I met Steve, I thought he was our\nsavior, so I immediately brought Jimmy in to get his impression,” Morris recalled.\nJobs could be extraordinarily charming when he wanted to be, and he turned it on\nwhen Iovine flew out to Cupertino for a demo. “See how simple it is?” he asked Iovine.\n“Your tech folks are never going to do this. There’s no one at the music companies who\ncan make it simple enough.”\nIovine called Morris right away. “This guy is unique!” he said. “You’re right. He’s\ngot a turnkey solution.” They complained about how they had spent two years working\nwith Sony, and it hadn’t gone anywhere. “Sony’s never going to figure things out,” he\ntold Morris. They agreed to quit dealing with Sony and join with Apple instead. “How\nSony missed this is completely mind-boggling to me, a historic fuckup,” Iovine said.\n“Steve would fire people if the divisions didn’t work together, but Sony’s divisions\nwere at war with one another.”\nIndeed  Sony  provided  a  clear  counterexample  to  Apple.  It  had  a  consumer\nelectronics division that made sleek products and a music division with beloved artists\n(including Bob Dylan). But because each division tried to protect its own interests, the\ncompany as a whole never got its act together to produce an end-to-end service.\nAndy Lack, the new head of Sony music, had the unenviable task of negotiating with\nJobs about whether Sony would sell its music in the iTunes Store. The irrepressible and\nsavvy  Lack  had  just  come  from  a  distinguished  career  in  television  journalism—a\nproducer at CBS News and president of NBC—and he knew how to size people up and\n\nkeep his sense of humor. He realized that, for Sony, selling its songs in the iTunes Store\nwas both insane and necessary—which seemed to be the case with a lot of decisions in\nthe music business. Apple would make out like a bandit, not just from its cut on song\nsales, but from driving the sale of iPods. Lack believed that since the music companies\nwould be responsible for the success of the iPod, they should get a royalty from each\ndevice sold.\nJobs would agree with Lack in many of their conversations and claim that he wanted\nto be a true partner with the music companies. “Steve, you’ve got me if you just give me\nsomething for every sale of your device,” Lack told him in his booming voice. “It’s a\nbeautiful device. But our music is helping to sell it. That’s what true partnership means\nto me.”\n“I’m with you,” Jobs replied on more than one occasion. But then he would go to\nDoug Morris and Roger Ames to lament, in a conspiratorial fashion, that Lack just\ndidn’t get it, that he was clueless about the music business, that he wasn’t as smart as\nMorris and Ames. “In classic Steve fashion, he would agree to something, but it would\nnever happen,” said Lack. “He would set you up and then pull it off the table. He’s\npathological, which can be useful in negotiations. And he’s a genius.”\nLack knew that he could not win his case unless he got support from others in the\nindustry. But Jobs used flattery and the lure of Apple’s marketing clout to keep the other\nrecord labels in line. “If the industry had stood together, we could have gotten a license\nfee, giving us the dual revenue stream we desperately needed,” Lack said. “We were the\nones making the iPod sell, so it would have been equitable.” That, of course, was one of\nthe beauties of Jobs’s end-to-end strategy: Sales of songs on iTunes would drive iPod\nsales, which would drive Macintosh sales. What made it all the more infuriating to Lack\nwas  that  Sony  could  have  done  the  same,  but  it  never  could  get  its  hardware  and\nsoftware and content divisions to row in unison.\nJobs tried hard to seduce Lack. During one visit to New York, he invited Lack to his\npenthouse at the Four Seasons hotel. Jobs had already ordered a breakfast spread—\noatmeal and berries for them both—and was “beyond solicitous,” Lack recalled. “But\nJack Welch taught me not to fall in love. Morris and Ames could be seduced. They\nwould say, ‘You don’t get it, you’re supposed to fall in love,’ and they did. So I ended\nup isolated in the industry.”\nEven  after  Sony  agreed  to  sell  its  music  in  the  iTunes  Store,  the  relationship\nremained  contentious.  Each  new  round  of  renewals  or  changes  would  bring  a\nshowdown. “With Andy, it was mostly about his big ego,” Jobs claimed. “He never\nreally understood the music business, and he could never really deliver. I thought he\nwas sometimes a dick.” When I told him what Jobs said, Lack responded, “I fought for\nSony and the music industry, so I can see why he thought I was a dick.”\nCorralling  the  record labels  to  go  along  with  the  iTunes  plan  was  not  enough,\nhowever.  Many  of  their  artists  had  carve-outs  in  their  contracts  that  allowed  them\npersonally to control the digital distribution of their music or prevent their songs from\n\nbeing unbundled from their albums and sold singly. So Jobs set about cajoling various\ntop musicians, which he found fun but also a lot harder than he expected.\nBefore the launch of iTunes, Jobs met with almost two dozen major artists, including\nBono, Mick Jagger, and Sheryl Crow. “He would call me at home, relentless, at ten at\nnight, to say he still needed to get to Led Zeppelin or Madonna,” Ames recalled. “He\nwas determined, and nobody else could have convinced some of these artists.”\nPerhaps  the  oddest  meeting  was  when  Dr.  Dre  came  to  visit  Jobs  at  Apple\nheadquarters. Jobs loved the Beatles and Dylan, but he admitted that the appeal of rap\neluded him. Now Jobs needed Eminem and other rappers to agree to be sold in the\niTunes  Store,  so  he  huddled  with  Dr.  Dre,  who  was  Eminem’s  mentor.  After  Jobs\nshowed him the seamless way the iTunes Store would work with the iPod, Dr. Dre\nproclaimed, “Man, somebody finally got it right.”\nOn the other end of the musical taste spectrum was the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.\nHe was on a West Coast fund-raising tour for Jazz at Lincoln Center and was meeting\nwith Jobs’s wife, Laurene. Jobs insisted that he come over to the house in Palo Alto,\nand he proceeded to show off iTunes. “What do you want to search for?” he asked\nMarsalis. Beethoven, the trumpeter replied. “Watch what it can do!” Jobs kept insisting\nwhen Marsalis’s attention would wander. “See how the interface works.” Marsalis later\nrecalled, “I don’t care much about computers, and kept telling him so, but he goes on for\ntwo hours. He was a man possessed. After a while, I started looking at him and not the\ncomputer, because I was so fascinated with his passion.”\nJobs unveiled the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003, at San Francisco’s Moscone Center.\nWith hair now closely cropped and receding, and a studied unshaven look, Jobs paced\nthe stage and described how Napster “demonstrated that the Internet was made for\nmusic delivery.” Its offspring, such as Kazaa, he said, offered songs for free. How do\nyou compete with that? To answer that question, he began by describing the downsides\nof using these free services. The downloads were unreliable and the quality was often\nbad. “A lot of these songs are encoded by seven-year-olds, and they don’t do a great\njob.” In addition, there were no previews or album art. Then he added, “Worst of all it’s\nstealing. It’s best not to mess with karma.”\nWhy had these piracy sites proliferated, then? Because, Jobs said, there was no\nalternative. The subscription services, such as Pressplay and MusicNet, “treat you like\na criminal,” he said, showing a slide of an inmate in striped prison garb. Then a slide of\nBob Dylan came on the screen. “People want to own the music they love.”\nAfter a lot of negotiating with the record companies, he said, “they were willing to\ndo something with us to change the world.” The iTunes Store would start with 200,000\ntracks, and it would grow each day. By using the store, he said, you can own your songs,\nburn them on CDs, be assured of the download quality, get a preview of a song before\nyou download it, and use it with your iMovies and iDVDs to “make the soundtrack of\n\nyour life.” The price? Just 99 cents, he said, less than a third of what a Starbucks latte\ncost. Why was it worth it? Because to get the right song from Kazaa took about fifteen\nminutes, rather than a minute. By spending an hour of your time to save about four\ndollars, he calculated, “you’re working for under the minimum wage!” And one more\nthing ... “With iTunes, it’s not stealing anymore. It’s good karma.”\nClapping the loudest for that line were the heads of the record labels in the front\nrow, including Doug Morris sitting next to Jimmy Iovine, in his usual baseball cap, and\nthe  whole  crowd  from  Warner  Music.  Eddy  Cue,  who  was  in  charge  of  the  store,\npredicted that Apple would sell a million songs in six months. Instead the iTunes Store\nsold a million songs in six days. “This will go down in history as a turning point for the\nmusic industry,” Jobs declared.\nMicrosoft\n“We were smoked.”\nThat  was  the  blunt  email  sent  to  four  colleagues  by  Jim  Allchin,  the  Microsoft\nexecutive in charge of Windows development, at 5 p.m. the day he saw the iTunes Store.\nIt had only one other line: “How did they get the music companies to go along?”\nLater that evening a reply came from David Cole, who was running Microsoft’s\nonline business group. “When Apple brings this to Windows (I assume they won’t make\nthe mistake of not bringing it to Windows), we will really be smoked.” He said that the\nWindows team needed “to bring this kind of solution to market,” adding, “That will\nrequire focus and goal alignment around an end-to-end service which delivers direct\nuser value, something we don’t have today.” Even though Microsoft had its own Internet\nservice (MSN), it was not used to providing end-to-end service the way Apple was.\nBill Gates himself weighed in at 10:46 that night. His subject line, “Apple’s Jobs\nagain,” indicated his frustration. “Steve Jobs’s ability to focus in on a few things that\ncount, get people who get user interface right, and market things as revolutionary are\namazing things,” he said. He too expressed surprise that Jobs had been able to convince\nthe music companies to go along with his store. “This is very strange to me. The music\ncompanies’ own operations offer a service that is truly unfriendly to the user. Somehow\nthey decide to give Apple the ability to do something pretty good.”\nGates also found it strange that no one else had created a service that allowed\npeople to buy songs rather than subscribe on a monthly basis. “I am not saying this\nstrangeness means we messed up—at least if we did, so did Real and Pressplay and\nMusicNet and basically everyone else,” he wrote. “Now that Jobs has done it we need\nto move fast to get something where the user interface and Rights are as good.... I think\nwe need some plan to prove that, even though Jobs has us a bit flat footed again, we can\nmove quick and both match and do stuff better.” It was an astonishing private admission:\n\nMicrosoft had again been caught flat-footed, and it would again try to catch up by\ncopying Apple. But like Sony, Microsoft could never make it happen, even after Jobs\nshowed the way.\nInstead Apple continued to smoke Microsoft in the way that Cole had predicted: It\nported the iTunes software and store to Windows. But that took some internal agonizing.\nFirst, Jobs and his team had to decide whether they wanted the iPod to work with\nWindows computers. Jobs was initially opposed. “By keeping the iPod for Mac only, it\nwas driving the sales of Macs even more than we expected,” he recalled. But lined up\nagainst  him  were  all  four  of  his  top  executives:  Schiller,  Rubinstein,  Robbin,  and\nFadell. It was an argument about what the future of Apple should be. “We felt we should\nbe in the music player business, not just in the Mac business,” said Schiller.\nJobs always wanted Apple to create its own unified utopia, a magical walled garden\nwhere hardware and software and peripheral devices worked well together to create a\ngreat  experience,  and  where  the  success  of  one  product  drove  sales  of  all  the\ncompanions. Now he was facing pressure to have his hottest new product work with\nWindows machines, and it went against his nature. “It was a really big argument for\nmonths,”  Jobs  recalled,  “me  against  everyone  else.”  At  one  point  he  declared  that\nWindows users would get to use iPods “over my dead body.” But still his team kept\npushing. “This needs to get to the PC,” said Fadell.\nFinally Jobs declared, “Until you can prove to me that it will make business sense,\nI’m not going to do it.” That was actually his way of backing down. If you put aside\nemotion and dogma, it was easy to prove that it made business sense to allow Windows\nusers to buy iPods. Experts were called in, sales scenarios developed, and everyone\nconcluded  this  would  bring  in  more  profits.  “We  developed  a  spreadsheet,”  said\nSchiller. “Under all scenarios, there was no amount of cannibalization of Mac sales that\nwould outweigh the sales of iPods.” Jobs was sometimes willing to surrender, despite\nhis reputation, but he never won any awards for gracious concession speeches. “Screw\nit,” he said at one meeting where they showed him the analysis. “I’m sick of listening to\nyou assholes. Go do whatever the hell you want.”\nThat left another question: When Apple allowed the iPod to be compatible with\nWindows machines, should it also create a version of iTunes to serve as the music-\nmanagement software for those Windows users? As usual, Jobs believed the hardware\nand software should go together: The user experience depended on the iPod working in\ncomplete  sync  (so  to  speak)  with  iTunes  software  on  the  computer.  Schiller  was\nopposed. “I thought that was crazy, since we don’t make Windows software,” Schiller\nrecalled. “But Steve kept arguing, ‘If we’re going to do it, we should do it right.’”\nSchiller prevailed at first. Apple decided to allow the iPod to work with Windows\nby using software from MusicMatch, an outside company. But the software was so\nclunky that it proved Jobs’s point, and Apple embarked on a fast-track effort to produce\niTunes for Windows. Jobs recalled:\n\nTo make the iPod work on PCs, we initially partnered with another company that had a\njukebox, gave them the secret sauce to connect to the iPod, and they did a crappy job.\nThat was the worst of all worlds, because this other company was controlling a big\npiece of the user experience. So we lived with this crappy outside jukebox for about six\nmonths, and then we finally got iTunes written for Windows. In the end, you just don’t\nwant someone else to control a big part of the user experience. People may disagree\nwith me, but I am pretty consistent about that.\nPorting iTunes to Windows meant going back to all of the music companies—which\nhad made deals to be in iTunes based on the assurance that it would be for only the\nsmall universe of Macintosh users—and negotiate again. Sony was especially resistant.\nAndy Lack thought it another example of Jobs changing the terms after a deal was done.\nIt was. But by then the other labels were happy about how the iTunes Store was working\nand went along, so Sony was forced to capitulate.\nJobs  announced  the  launch  of  iTunes  for  Windows  in  October  2003.  “Here’s  a\nfeature that people thought we’d never add until this happened,” he said, waving his\nhand at the giant screen behind him. “Hell froze over,” proclaimed the slide. The show\nincluded iChat appearances and videos from Mick Jagger, Dr. Dre, and Bono. “It’s a\nvery cool thing for musicians and music,” Bono said of the iPod and iTunes. “That’s\nwhy I’m here to kiss the corporate ass. I don’t kiss everybody’s.”\nJobs was never prone to understatement. To the cheers of the crowd, he declared,\n“iTunes for Windows is probably the best Windows app ever written.”\nMicrosoft was not grateful. “They’re pursuing the same strategy that they pursued in the\nPC business, controlling both the hardware and software,” Bill Gates told Business\nWeek. “We’ve always done things a little bit differently than Apple in terms of giving\npeople choice.” It was not until three years later, in November 2006, that Microsoft was\nfinally able to release its own answer to the iPod. It was called the Zune, and it looked\nlike an iPod, though a bit clunkier. Two years later it had achieved a market share of\nless than 5%. Jobs was brutal about the cause of the Zune’s uninspired design and\nmarket weakness:\nThe older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy\nbecause the people at Microsoft don’t really love music or art the way we do. We won\nbecause we personally love music. We made the iPod for ourselves, and when you’re\ndoing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you’re not going to cheese\nout. If you don’t love something, you’re not going to go the extra mile, work the extra\nweekend, challenge the status quo as much.\n\nMr. Tambourine Man\nAndy Lack’s first annual meeting at Sony was in April 2003, the same week that Apple\nlaunched the iTunes Store. He had been made head of the music division four months\nearlier, and had spent much of that time negotiating with Jobs. In fact he arrived in\nTokyo directly from Cupertino, carrying the latest version of the iPod and a description\nof the iTunes Store. In front of the two hundred managers gathered, he pulled the iPod\nout of his pocket. “Here it is,” he said as CEO Nobuyuki Idei and Sony’s North America\nhead Howard Stringer looked on. “Here’s the Walkman killer. There’s no mystery meat.\nThe reason you bought a music company is so that you could be the one to make a\ndevice like this. You can do better.”\nBut Sony couldn’t. It had pioneered portable music with the Walkman, it had a great\nrecord company, and it had a long history of making beautiful consumer devices. It had\nall of the assets to compete with Jobs’s strategy of integration of hardware, software,\ndevices, and content sales. Why did it fail? Partly because it was a company, like AOL\nTime Warner, that was organized into divisions (that word itself was ominous) with\ntheir own bottom lines; the goal of achieving synergy in such companies by prodding the\ndivisions to work together was usually elusive.\nJobs did not organize Apple into semiautonomous divisions; he closely controlled\nall of his teams and pushed them to work as one cohesive and flexible company, with\none profit-and-loss bottom line. “We don’t have ‘divisions’ with their own P&L,” said\nTim Cook. “We run one P&L for the company.”\nIn addition, like many companies, Sony worried about cannibalization. If it built a\nmusic player and service that made it easy for people to share digital songs, that might\nhurt sales of its record division. One of Jobs’s business rules was to never be afraid of\ncannibalizing yourself. “If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will,” he said.\nSo  even  though  an  iPhone  might  cannibalize  sales  of  an  iPod,  or  an  iPad  might\ncannibalize sales of a laptop, that did not deter him.\nThat July, Sony appointed a veteran of the music industry, Jay Samit, to create its\nown  iTunes-like  service,  called  Sony  Connect,  which  would  sell  songs  online  and\nallow them to play on Sony’s portable music devices. “The move was immediately\nunderstood  as  a  way  to  unite  the  sometimes  conflicting  electronics  and  content\ndivisions,” the New York Times reported. “That internal battle was seen by many as the\nreason Sony, the inventor of the Walkman and the biggest player in the portable audio\nmarket, was being trounced by Apple.” Sony Connect launched in May 2004. It lasted\njust over three years before Sony shut it down.\nMicrosoft was willing to license its Windows Media software and digital rights format\nto other companies, just as it had licensed out its operating system in the 1980s. Jobs, on\nthe  other  hand,  would  not  license  out  Apple’s  FairPlay  to  other  device  makers;  it\n\nworked only on an iPod. Nor would he allow other online stores to sell songs for use on\niPods. A variety of experts said this would eventually cause Apple to lose market share,\nas it did in the computer wars of the 1980s. “If Apple continues to rely on a proprietary\narchitecture,” the Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen told Wired,\n“the iPod will likely become a niche product.” (Other than in this case, Christensen was\none of the world’s most insightful business analysts, and Jobs was deeply influenced by\nhis book The  Innovator’s  Dilemma.) Bill Gates made the same argument. “There’s\nnothing unique about music,” he said. “This story has played out on the PC.”\nRob Glaser, the founder of RealNetworks, tried to circumvent Apple’s restrictions in\nJuly 2004 with a service called Harmony. He had attempted to convince Jobs to license\nApple’s FairPlay format to Harmony, but when that didn’t happen, Glaser just reverse-\nengineered it and used it with the songs that Harmony sold. Glaser’s strategy was that\nthe songs sold by Harmony would play on any device, including an iPod or a Zune or a\nRio, and he launched a marketing campaign with the slogan “Freedom of Choice.” Jobs\nwas furious and issued a release saying that Apple was “stunned that RealNetworks has\nadopted  the  tactics  and  ethics of  a  hacker  to  break  into  the  iPod.”  RealNetworks\nresponded by launching an Internet petition that demanded “Hey Apple! Don’t break my\niPod.” Jobs kept quiet for a few months, but in October he released a new version of the\niPod software that caused songs bought through Harmony to become inoperable. “Steve\nis a one-of-a-kind guy,” Glaser said. “You know that about him when you do business\nwith him.”\nIn the meantime Jobs and his team—Rubinstein, Fadell, Robbin, Ive—were able to\nkeep coming up with new versions of the iPod that extended Apple’s lead. The first\nmajor revision, announced in January 2004, was the iPod Mini. Far smaller than the\noriginal iPod—just the size of a business card—it had less capacity and was about the\nsame price. At one point Jobs decided to kill it, not seeing why anyone would want to\npay the same for less. “He doesn’t do sports, so he didn’t relate to how it would be\ngreat on a run or in the gym,” said Fadell. In fact the Mini was what truly launched the\niPod  to  market  dominance,  by  eliminating  the  competition  from  smaller  flash-drive\nplayers. In the eighteen months after it was introduced, Apple’s market share in the\nportable music player market shot from 31% to 74%.\nThe iPod Shuffle, introduced in January 2005, was even more revolutionary. Jobs\nlearned that the shuffle feature on the iPod, which played songs in random order, had\nbecome very popular. People liked to be surprised, and they were also too lazy to keep\nsetting up and revising their playlists. Some users even became obsessed with figuring\nout whether the song selection was truly random, and if so, why their iPod kept coming\nback to, say, the Neville Brothers. That feature led to the iPod Shuffle. As Rubinstein\nand Fadell were working on creating a flash player that was small and inexpensive, they\nkept doing things like making the screen tinier. At one point Jobs came in with a crazy\nsuggestion: Get rid of the screen altogether. “What?!?” Fadell responded. “Just get rid\nof it,” Jobs insisted. Fadell asked how users would navigate the songs. Jobs’s insight\n\nwas that you wouldn’t need to navigate; the songs would play randomly. After all, they\nwere songs you had chosen. All that was needed was a button to skip over a song if you\nweren’t in the mood for it. “Embrace uncertainty,” the ads read.\nAs competitors stumbled and Apple continued to innovate, music became a larger\npart of Apple’s business. In January 2007 iPod sales were half of Apple’s revenues.\nThe device also added luster to the Apple brand. But an even bigger success was the\niTunes Store. Having sold one million songs in the first six days after it was introduced\nin  April  2003,  the  store  went  on  to  sell  seventy  million  songs  in  its  first  year.  In\nFebruary 2006 the store sold its one billionth song when Alex Ostrovsky, sixteen, of\nWest  Bloomfield,  Michigan,  bought  Coldplay’s  “Speed  of  Sound”  and  got  a\ncongratulatory call from Jobs, bestowing upon him ten iPods, an iMac, and a $10,000\nmusic gift certificate.\nThe success of the iTunes Store also had a more subtle benefit. By 2011 an important\nnew  business  had  emerged:  being  the  service  that  people  trusted  with  their  online\nidentity and payment information. Along with Amazon, Visa, PayPal, American Express,\nand a few other services, Apple had built up databases of people who trusted them with\ntheir email address and credit card information to facilitate safe and easy shopping.\nThis allowed Apple to sell, for example, a magazine subscription through its online\nstore; when that happened, Apple, not the magazine publisher, would have a direct\nrelationship  with  the  subscriber.  As  the  iTunes  Store  sold  videos,  apps,  and\nsubscriptions, it built up a database of 225 million active users by June 2011, which\npositioned Apple for the next age of digital commerce.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\nMUSIC MAN\nThe Sound Track of His Life\nJimmy Iovine, Bono, Jobs, and The Edge, 2004\nOn His iPod\nAs the iPod phenomenon grew, it spawned a question that was asked of presidential\ncandidates, B-list celebrities, first dates, the queen of England, and just about anyone\nelse  with  white  earbuds:  “What’s  on  your  iPod?”  The  parlor  game  took  off  when\nElisabeth Bumiller wrote a piece in the New York Times in early 2005 dissecting the\nanswer that President George W. Bush gave when she asked him that question. “Bush’s\niPod is heavy on traditional country singers,” she reported. “He has selections by Van\nMorrison, whose ‘Brown Eyed Girl’ is a Bush favorite, and by John Fogerty, most\npredictably ‘Centerfield.’” She got a Rolling Stone editor, Joe Levy, to analyze the\nselection, and he commented, “One thing that’s interesting is that the president likes\nartists who don’t like him.”\n\n“Simply handing over your iPod to a friend, your blind date, or the total stranger\nsitting next to you on the plane opens you up like a book,” Steven Levy wrote in The\nPerfect Thing. “All somebody needs to do is scroll through your library on that click\nwheel, and, musically speaking, you’re naked. It’s not just what you like—it’s who you\nare.” So one day, when we were sitting in his living room listening to music, I asked\nJobs to let me see his. As we sat there, he flicked through his favorite songs.\nNot surprisingly, there were all six volumes of Dylan’s bootleg series, including the\ntracks Jobs had first started worshipping when he and Wozniak were able to score them\non reel-to-reel tapes years before the series was officially released. In addition, there\nwere fifteen other Dylan albums, starting with his first, Bob Dylan (1962), but going\nonly up to Oh Mercy (1989). Jobs had spent a lot of time arguing with Andy Hertzfeld\nand others that Dylan’s subsequent albums, indeed any of his albums after Blood on the\nTracks (1975), were not as powerful as his early performances. The one exception he\nmade was Dylan’s track “Things Have Changed” from the 2000 movie Wonder Boys.\nNotably his iPod did not include Empire Burlesque (1985), the album that Hertzfeld\nhad brought him the weekend he was ousted from Apple.\nThe other great trove on his iPod was the Beatles. He included songs from seven of\ntheir albums: A Hard Day’s Night, Abbey Road, Help!, Let It Be, Magical Mystery\nTour, Meet the Beatles! and Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. The solo albums\nmissed the cut. The Rolling Stones clocked in next, with six albums: Emotional Rescue,\nFlashpoint, Jump Back, Some Girls, Sticky Fingers, and Tattoo You. In the case of the\nDylan and the Beatles albums, most were included in their entirety. But true to his belief\nthat albums can and should be disaggregated, those of the Stones and most other artists\non his iPod included only three or four cuts. His onetime girlfriend Joan Baez was\namply represented by selections from four albums, including two different versions of\n“Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word.”\nHis iPod selections were those of a kid from the seventies with his heart in the\nsixties. There were Aretha, B. B. King, Buddy Holly, Buffalo Springfield, Don McLean,\nDonovan, the Doors, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, John\nMellencamp, Simon and Garfunkel, and even The Monkees (“I’m a Believer”) and Sam\nthe  Sham  (“Wooly  Bully”).  Only  about  a  quarter  of  the  songs  were  from  more\ncontemporary artists, such as 10,000 Maniacs, Alicia Keys, Black Eyed Peas, Coldplay,\nDido, Green Day, John Mayer (a friend of both his and Apple), Moby (likewise), U2,\nSeal, and Talking Heads. As for classical music, there were a few recordings of Bach,\nincluding the Brandenburg Concertos, and three albums by Yo-Yo Ma.\nJobs told Sheryl Crow in May 2003 that he was downloading some Eminem tracks,\nadmitting, “He’s starting to grow on me.” James Vincent subsequently took him to an\nEminem concert. Even so, the rapper missed making it onto Jobs’s iPod. As Jobs said to\nVincent after the concert, “I don’t know ...” He later told me, “I respect Eminem as an\nartist, but I just don’t want to listen to his music, and I can’t relate to his values the way\nI can to Dylan’s.”\n\nHis favorites did not change over the years. When the iPad 2 came out in March\n2011, he transferred his favorite music to it. One afternoon we sat in his living room as\nhe scrolled through the songs on his new iPad and, with a mellow nostalgia, tapped on\nones he wanted to hear.\nWe  went  through  the  usual  Dylan  and  Beatles  favorites,  then  he  became  more\nreflective  and  tapped  on  a  Gregorian  chant,  “Spiritus  Domini,”  performed  by\nBenedictine monks. For a minute or so he zoned out, almost in a trance. “That’s really\nbeautiful,” he murmured. He followed with Bach’s Second Brandenburg Concerto and a\nfugue from The Well-Tempered Clavier. Bach, he declared, was his favorite classical\ncomposer.  He  was  particularly  fond  of  listening  to  the  contrasts  between  the  two\nversions of the “Goldberg Variations” that Glenn Gould recorded, the first in 1955 as a\ntwenty-two-year-old little-known pianist and the second in 1981, a year before he died.\n“They’re like night and day,” Jobs said after playing them sequentially one afternoon.\n“The first is an exuberant, young, brilliant piece, played so fast it’s a revelation. The\nlater one is so much more spare and stark. You sense a very deep soul who’s been\nthrough a lot in life. It’s deeper and wiser.” Jobs was on his third medical leave that\nafternoon when he played both versions, and I asked which he liked better. “Gould liked\nthe later version much better,” he said. “I used to like the earlier, exuberant one. But\nnow I can see where he was coming from.”\nHe then jumped from the sublime to the sixties: Donovan’s “Catch the Wind.” When\nhe noticed me look askance, he protested, “Donovan did some really good stuff, really.”\nHe punched up “Mellow Yellow,” and then admitted that perhaps it was not the best\nexample. “It sounded better when we were young.”\nI asked what music from our childhood actually held up well these days. He scrolled\ndown the list on his iPad and called up the Grateful Dead’s 1969 song “Uncle John’s\nBand.” He nodded along with the lyrics: “When life looks like Easy Street, there is\ndanger at your door.” For a moment we were back at that tumultuous time when the\nmellowness of the sixties was ending in discord. “Whoa, oh, what I want to know is,\nare you kind?”\nThen he turned to Joni Mitchell. “She had a kid she put up for adoption,” he said.\n“This song is about her little girl.” He tapped on “Little Green,” and we listened to the\nmournful melody and lyrics that describe the feelings of a mother who gives up a child.\n“So you sign all the papers in the family name / You’re sad and you’re sorry, but you’re\nnot ashamed.” I asked whether he still often thought about being put up for adoption.\n“No, not much,” he said. “Not too often.”\nThese days, he said, he thought more about getting older than about his birth. That\nled him to play Joni Mitchell’s greatest song, “Both Sides Now,” with its lyrics about\nbeing older and wiser: “I’ve looked at life from both sides now, / From win and lose,\nand still somehow, / It’s life’s illusions I recall, / I really don’t know life at all.” As\nGlenn  Gould  had  done  with  Bach’s  “Goldberg  Variations,”  Mitchell  had  recorded\n\n“Both Sides Now” many years apart, first in 1969 and then in an excruciatingly haunting\nslow version in 2000. He played the latter. “It’s interesting how people age,” he noted.\nSome people, he added, don’t age well even when they are young. I asked who he\nhad in mind. “John Mayer is one of the best guitar players who’s ever lived, and I’m\njust afraid he’s blowing it big time,” Jobs replied. Jobs liked Mayer and occasionally\nhad him over for dinner in Palo Alto. When he was twenty-seven, Mayer appeared at\nthe January 2004 Macworld, where Jobs introduced GarageBand, and he became a\nfixture at the event most years. Jobs punched up Mayer’s hit “Gravity.” The lyrics are\nabout  a  guy  filled  with  love  who  inexplicably  dreams  of  ways  to  throw  it  away:\n“Gravity is working against me, / And gravity wants to bring me down.” Jobs shook his\nhead and commented, “I think he’s a really good kid underneath, but he’s just been out of\ncontrol.”\nAt the end of the listening session, I asked him a well-worn question: the Beatles or\nthe Stones? “If the vault was on fire and I could grab only one set of master tapes, I\nwould grab the Beatles,” he answered. “The hard one would be between the Beatles\nand Dylan. Somebody else could have replicated the Stones. No one could have been\nDylan or the Beatles.” As he was ruminating about how fortunate we were to have all of\nthem  when  we  were  growing  up,  his  son,  then  eighteen,  came  in  the  room.  “Reed\ndoesn’t understand,” Jobs lamented. Or perhaps he did. He was wearing a Joan Baez T-\nshirt, with the words “Forever Young” on it.\nBob Dylan\nThe only time Jobs can ever recall being tongue-tied was in the presence of Bob Dylan.\nHe was playing near Palo Alto in October 2004, and Jobs was recovering from his first\ncancer surgery. Dylan was not a gregarious man, not a Bono or a Bowie. He was never\nJobs’s friend, nor did he care to be. He did, however, invite Jobs to visit him at his\nhotel before the concert. Jobs recalled:\nWe sat on the patio outside his room and talked for two hours. I was really nervous,\nbecause he was one of my heroes. And I was also afraid that he wouldn’t be really\nsmart anymore, that he’d be a caricature of himself, like happens to a lot of people. But\nI was delighted. He was as sharp as a tack. He was everything I’d hoped. He was really\nopen and honest. He was just telling me about his life and about writing his songs. He\nsaid, “They just came through me, it wasn’t like I was having to compose them. That\ndoesn’t happen anymore, I just can’t write them that way anymore.” Then he paused and\nsaid to me with his raspy voice and little smile, “But I still can sing them.”\n\nThe next time Dylan played nearby, he invited Jobs to drop by his tricked-up tour\nbus just before the concert. When Dylan asked what his favorite song was, Jobs said\n“One Too Many Mornings.” So Dylan sang it that night. After the concert, as Jobs was\nwalking out the back, the tour bus came by and screeched to a stop. The door flipped\nopen. “So, did you hear my song I sang for you?” Dylan rasped. Then he drove off.\nWhen Jobs tells the tale, he does a pretty good impression of Dylan’s voice. “He’s one\nof my all-time heroes,” Jobs recalled. “My love for him has grown over the years, it’s\nripened. I can’t figure out how he did it when he was so young.”\nA few months after seeing him in concert, Jobs came up with a grandiose plan. The\niTunes Store should offer a digital “boxed set” of every Dylan song ever recorded,\nmore than seven hundred in all, for $199. Jobs would be the curator of Dylan for the\ndigital age. But Andy Lack of Sony, which was Dylan’s label, was in no mood to make a\ndeal without some serious concessions regarding iTunes. In addition, Lack felt the price\nwas too low and would cheapen Dylan. “Bob is a national treasure,” said Lack, “and\nSteve wanted him on iTunes at a price that commoditized him.” It got to the heart of the\nproblems that Lack and other record executives were having with Jobs: He was getting\nto set the price points, not them. So Lack said no.\n“Okay, then I will call Dylan directly,” Jobs said. But it was not the type of thing that\nDylan ever dealt with, so it fell to his agent, Jeff Rosen, to sort things out.\n“It’s a really bad idea,” Lack told Rosen, showing him the numbers. “Bob is Steve’s\nhero. He’ll sweeten the deal.” Lack had both a professional and a personal desire to\nfend Jobs off, even to yank his chain a bit. So he made an offer to Rosen. “I will write\nyou a check for a million dollars tomorrow if you hold off for the time being.” As Lack\nlater explained, it was an advance against future royalties, “one of those accounting\nthings record companies do.” Rosen called back forty-five minutes later and accepted.\n“Andy worked things out with us and asked us not to do it, which we didn’t,” he\nrecalled. “I think Andy gave us some sort of an advance to hold off doing it.”\nBy 2006, however, Lack had stepped aside as the CEO of what was by then Sony\nBMG, and Jobs reopened negotiations. He sent Dylan an iPod with all of his songs on\nit, and he showed Rosen the type of marketing campaign that Apple could mount. In\nAugust he announced a grand deal. It allowed Apple to sell the $199 digital boxed set\nof all the songs Dylan ever recorded, plus the exclusive right to offer Dylan’s new\nalbum, Modern Times, for pre-release orders. “Bob Dylan is one of the most respected\npoets and musicians of our time, and he is a personal hero of mine,” Jobs said at the\nannouncement. The 773-track set included forty-two rarities, such as a 1961 tape of\n“Wade in the Water” made in a Minnesota hotel, a 1962 version of “Handsome Molly”\nfrom  a  live  concert  at  the  Gaslight  Café  in  Greenwich  Village,  the  truly  awesome\nrendition  of  “Mr.  Tambourine  Man”  from  the  1964  Newport  Folk  Festival  (Jobs’s\nfavorite), and an acoustic version of “Outlaw Blues” from 1965.\nAs part of the deal, Dylan appeared in a television ad for the iPod, featuring his new\nalbum, Modern Times. This was one of the most astonishing cases of flipping the script\n\nsince Tom Sawyer persuaded his friends to whitewash the fence. In the past, getting\ncelebrities to do an ad required paying them a lot of money. But by 2006 the tables were\nturned.  Major  artists wanted  to  appear  in  iPod  ads;  the  exposure  would  guarantee\nsuccess. James Vincent had predicted this a few years earlier, when Jobs said he had\ncontacts with many musicians and could pay them to appear in ads. “No, things are\ngoing to soon change,” Vincent replied. “Apple is a different kind of brand, and it’s\ncooler than the brand of most artists. We should talk about the opportunity we offer the\nbands, not pay them.”\nLee  Clow  recalled  that  there  was  actually  some  resistance  among  the  younger\nstaffers at Apple and the ad agency to using Dylan. “They wondered whether he was\nstill cool enough,” Clow said. Jobs would hear none of that. He was thrilled to have\nDylan.\nJobs became obsessed by every detail of the Dylan commercial. Rosen flew to\nCupertino so that they could go through the album and pick the song they wanted to use,\nwhich ended up being “Someday Baby.” Jobs approved a test video that Clow made\nusing a stand-in for Dylan, which was then shot in Nashville with Dylan himself. But\nwhen it came back, Jobs hated it. It wasn’t distinctive enough. He wanted a new style.\nSo Clow hired another director, and Rosen was able to convince Dylan to retape the\nentire commercial. This time it was done with a gently backlit cowboy-hatted Dylan\nsitting on a stool, strumming and singing, while a hip woman in a newsboy cap dances\nwith her iPod. Jobs loved it.\nThe  ad  showed  the  halo  effect  of  the  iPod’s  marketing:  It  helped  Dylan  win  a\nyounger audience, just as the iPod had done for Apple computers. Because of the ad,\nDylan’s album was number one on the Billboard chart its first week, topping hot-selling\nalbums by Christina Aguilera and Outkast. It was the first time Dylan had reached the\ntop spot since Desire in 1976, thirty years earlier. Ad Age headlined Apple’s role in\npropelling Dylan. “The iTunes spot wasn’t just a run-of-the-mill celebrity-endorsement\ndeal in which a big brand signs a big check to tap into the equity of a big star,” it\nreported. “This one flipped the formula, with the all-powerful Apple brand giving Mr.\nDylan access to younger demographics and helping propel his sales to places they\nhadn’t been since the Ford administration.”\nThe Beatles\nAmong Jobs’s prized CDs was a bootleg that contained a dozen or so taped sessions of\nthe Beatles revising “Strawberry Fields Forever.” It became the musical score to his\nphilosophy of how to perfect a product. Andy Hertzfeld had found the CD and made a\ncopy of it for Jobs in 1986, though Jobs sometimes told folks that it had come from\nYoko Ono. Sitting in the living room of his Palo Alto home one day, Jobs rummaged\n\naround in some glass-enclosed bookcases to find it, then put it on while describing what\nit had taught him:\nIt’s a complex song, and it’s fascinating to watch the creative process as they went back\nand forth and finally created it over a few months. Lennon was always my favorite\nBeatle. [He laughs as Lennon stops during the first take and makes the band go back and\nrevise a chord.] Did you hear that little detour they took? It didn’t work, so they went\nback and started from where they were. It’s so raw in this version. It actually makes\nthem sound like mere mortals. You could actually imagine other people doing this, up to\nthis version. Maybe not writing and conceiving it, but certainly playing it. Yet they just\ndidn’t stop. They were such perfectionists they kept it going and going. This made a big\nimpression on me when I was in my thirties. You could just tell how much they worked\nat this.\nThey did a bundle of work between each of these recordings. They kept sending it\nback to make it closer to perfect. [As he listens to the third take, he points out how the\ninstrumentation has gotten more complex.] The way we build stuff at Apple is often this\nway. Even the number of models we’d make of a new notebook or iPod. We would start\noff with a version and then begin refining and refining, doing detailed models of the\ndesign, or the buttons, or how a function operates. It’s a lot of work, but in the end it just\ngets better, and soon it’s like, “Wow, how did they do that?!? Where are the screws?”\nIt was thus understandable that Jobs was driven to distraction by the fact that the Beatles\nwere not on iTunes.\nHis struggle with Apple Corps, the Beatles’ business holding company, stretched\nmore than three decades, causing too many journalists to use the phrase “long and\nwinding road” in stories about the relationship.\nIt began in 1978, when Apple Computers, soon after its launch, was sued by Apple\nCorps for trademark infringement, based on the fact that the Beatles’ former recording\nlabel was called Apple. The suit was settled three years later, when Apple Computers\npaid Apple Corps $80,000. The settlement had what seemed back then an innocuous\nstipulation: The Beatles would not produce any computer equipment and Apple would\nnot market any music products.\nThe  Beatles  kept  their  end  of  the  bargain;  none  of  them  ever  produced  any\ncomputers. But Apple ended up wandering into the music business. It got sued again in\n1991, when the Mac incorporated the ability to play musical files, then again in 2003,\nwhen the iTunes Store was launched. The legal issues were finally resolved in 2007,\nwhen Apple made a deal to pay Apple Corps $500 million for all worldwide rights to\nthe name, and then licensed back to the Beatles the right to use Apple Corps for their\nrecord and business holdings.\n\nAlas, this did not resolve the issue of getting the Beatles onto iTunes. For that to\nhappen, the Beatles and EMI Music, which held the rights to most of their songs, had to\nnegotiate their own differences over how to handle the digital rights. “The Beatles all\nwant to be on iTunes,” Jobs later recalled, “but they and EMI are like an old married\ncouple. They hate each other but can’t get divorced. The fact that my favorite band was\nthe last holdout from iTunes was something I very much hoped I would live to resolve.”\nAs it turned out, he would.\nBono\nBono, the lead singer of U2, deeply appreciated Apple’s marketing muscle. He was\nconfident that his Dublin-based band was still the best in the world, but in 2004 it was\ntrying, after almost thirty years together, to reinvigorate its image. It had produced an\nexciting new album with a song that the band’s lead guitarist, The Edge, declared to be\n“the mother of all rock tunes.” Bono knew he needed to find a way to get it some\ntraction, so he placed a call to Jobs.\n“I wanted something specific from Apple,” Bono recalled. “We had a song called\n‘Vertigo’ that featured an aggressive guitar riff that I knew would be contagious, but\nonly if people were exposed to it many, many times.” He was worried that the era of\npromoting a song through airplay on the radio was over. So Bono visited Jobs at home\nin Palo Alto, walked around the garden, and made an unusual pitch. Over the years U2\nhad spurned offers as high as $23 million to be in commercials. Now he wanted Jobs to\nuse the band in an iPod commercial for free—or at least as part of a mutually beneficial\npackage. “They had never done a commercial before,” Jobs later recalled. “But they\nwere getting ripped off by free downloading, they liked what we were doing with\niTunes, and they thought we could promote them to a younger audience.”\nAny other CEO would have jumped into a mosh pit to have U2 in an ad, but Jobs\npushed  back  a  bit.  Apple  didn’t  feature  recognizable  people  in  the  iPod  ads,  just\nsilhouettes. (The Dylan ad had not yet been made.) “You have silhouettes of fans,” Bono\nreplied, “so couldn’t the next phase be silhouettes of artists?” Jobs said it sounded like\nan idea worth exploring. Bono left a copy of the unreleased album, How to Dismantle\nan Atomic Bomb, for Jobs to hear. “He was the only person outside the band who had\nit,” Bono said.\nA  round  of  meetings  ensued.  Jobs  flew  down  to  talk  to  Jimmy  Iovine,  whose\nInterscope records distributed U2, at his house in the Holmby Hills section of Los\nAngeles. The Edge was there, along with U2’s manager, Paul McGuinness. Another\nmeeting took place in Jobs’s kitchen, with McGuinness writing down the deal points in\nthe back of his diary. U2 would appear in the commercial, and Apple would vigorously\npromote the album in multiple venues, ranging from billboards to the iTunes homepage.\n\nThe band would get no direct fee, but it would get royalties from the sale of a special\nU2 edition of the iPod. Bono believed, like Lack, that the musicians should get a royalty\non each iPod sold, and this was his small attempt to assert the principle in a limited\nway for his band. “Bono and I asked Steve to make us a black one,” Iovine recalled.\n“We weren’t just doing a commercial sponsorship, we were making a co-branding\ndeal.”\n“We wanted our own iPod, something distinct from the regular white ones,” Bono\nrecalled. “We wanted black, but Steve said, ‘We’ve tried other colors than white, and\nthey don’t work.’” A few days later Jobs relented and accepted the idea, tentatively.\nThe commercial interspersed high-voltage shots of the band in partial silhouette with\nthe usual silhouette of a dancing woman listening to an iPod. But even as it was being\nshot in London, the agreement with Apple was unraveling. Jobs began having second\nthoughts about the idea of a special black iPod, and the royalty rates were not fully\npinned down. He called James Vincent, at Apple’s ad agency, and told him to call\nLondon and put things on hold. “I don’t think it’s going to happen,” Jobs said. “They\ndon’t realize how much value we are giving them, it’s going south. Let’s think of some\nother ad to do.” Vincent, a lifelong U2 fan, knew how big the ad would be, both for the\nband and Apple, and begged for the chance to call Bono to try to get things on track.\nJobs  gave  him  Bono’s  mobile  number,  and  he  reached  the  singer  in  his  kitchen  in\nDublin.\nBono was also having a few second thoughts. “I don’t think this is going to work,” he\ntold Vincent. “The band is reluctant.” Vincent asked what the problem was. “When we\nwere  teenagers  in  Dublin,  we  said  we  would  never  do  naff  stuff,”  Bono  replied.\nVincent, despite being British and familiar with rock slang, said he didn’t know what\nthat meant. “Doing rubbishy things for money,” Bono explained. “We are all about our\nfans. We feel like we’d be letting them down if we went in an ad. It doesn’t feel right.\nI’m sorry we wasted your time.”\nVincent asked what more Apple could do to make it work. “We are giving you the\nmost important thing we have to give, and that’s our music,” said Bono. “And what are\nyou giving us back? Advertising, and our fans will think it’s for you. We need something\nmore.” Vincent replied that the offer of the special U2 edition of the iPod and the royalty\narrangement was a huge deal. “That’s the most prized thing we have to give,” he told\nBono.\nThe  singer  said  he  was  ready  to  try  to  put  the  deal  back  together,  so  Vincent\nimmediately called Jony Ive, another big U2 fan (he had first seen them in concert in\nNewcastle in 1983), and described the situation. Then he called Jobs and suggested he\nsend Ive to Dublin to show what the black iPod would look like. Jobs agreed. Vincent\ncalled Bono back, and asked if he knew Jony Ive, unaware that they had met before and\nadmired each other. “Know Jony Ive?” Bono laughed. “I love that guy. I drink his\nbathwater.”\n\n“That’s a bit strong,” Vincent replied, “but how about letting him come visit and\nshow how cool your iPod would be?”\n“I’m going to pick him up myself in my Maserati,” Bono answered. “He’s going to\nstay at my house, I’m going to take him out, and I will get him really drunk.”\nThe next day, as Ive headed toward Dublin, Vincent had to fend off Jobs, who was\nstill having second thoughts. “I don’t know if we’re doing the right thing,” he said. “We\ndon’t want to do this for anyone else.” He was worried about setting the precedent of\nartists getting a royalty from each iPod sold. Vincent assured him that the U2 deal would\nbe special.\n“Jony arrived in Dublin and I put him up at my guest house, a serene place over a\nrailway track with a view of the sea,” Bono recalled. “He shows me this beautiful black\niPod with a deep red click wheel, and I say okay, we’ll do it.” They went to a local\npub, hashed out some of the details, and then called Jobs in Cupertino to see if he would\nagree. Jobs haggled for a while over each detail of the finances, and over the design,\nbefore he finally embraced the deal. That impressed Bono. “It’s actually amazing that a\nCEO cares that much about detail,” he said. When it was resolved, Ive and Bono settled\ninto  some  serious  drinking.  Both  are  comfortable  in  pubs.  After  a  few  pints,  they\ndecided to call Vincent back in California. He was not home, so Bono left a message on\nhis answering machine, which Vincent made sure never to erase. “I’m sitting here in\nbubbling Dublin with your friend Jony,” it said. “We’re both a bit drunk, and we’re\nhappy with this wonderful iPod and I can’t even believe it exists and I’m holding it in\nmy hand. Thank you!”\nJobs rented a theater in San Jose for the unveiling of the TV commercial and special\niPod. Bono and The Edge joined him onstage. The album sold 840,000 copies in its first\nweek and debuted at number one on the Billboard chart. Bono told the press afterward\nthat he had done the commercial without charge because “U2 will get as much value out\nof the commercial as Apple will.” Jimmy Iovine added that it would allow the band to\n“reach a younger audience.”\nWhat was remarkable was that associating with a computer and electronics company\nwas the best way for a rock band to seem hip and appeal to young people. Bono later\nexplained that not all corporate sponsorships were deals with the devil. “Let’s have a\nlook,” he told Greg Kot, the Chicago Tribune music critic. “The ‘devil’ here is a bunch\nof creative minds, more creative than a lot of people in rock bands. The lead singer is\nSteve Jobs. These men have helped design the most beautiful art object in music culture\nsince the electric guitar. That’s the iPod. The job of art is to chase ugliness away.”\nBono got Jobs to do another deal with him in 2006, this one for his Product Red\ncampaign that raised money and awareness to fight AIDS in Africa. Jobs was never\nmuch interested in philanthropy, but he agreed to do a special red iPod as part of Bono’s\ncampaign. It was not a wholehearted commitment. He balked, for example, at using the\ncampaign’s signature treatment of putting the name of the company in parentheses with\nthe  word  “red”  in  superscript  after  it,  as  in  (APPLE)\nRED\n.  “I  don’t  want  Apple  in\n\nparentheses,” Jobs insisted. Bono replied, “But Steve, that’s how we show unity for our\ncause.” The conversation got heated—to the F-you stage—before they agreed to sleep\non it. Finally Jobs compromised, sort of. Bono could do what he wanted in his ads, but\nJobs would never put Apple in parentheses on any of his products or in any of his\nstores. The iPod was labeled (PRODUCT)\nRED\n, not (APPLE)\nRED\n.\n“Steve can be sparky,” Bono recalled, “but those moments have made us closer\nfriends, because there are not many people in your life where you can have those robust\ndiscussions. He’s very opinionated. After our shows, I talk to him and he’s always got\nan opinion.” Jobs and his family occasionally visited Bono and his wife and four kids at\ntheir home near Nice on the French Riviera. On one vacation, in 2008, Jobs chartered a\nboat and moored it near Bono’s home. They ate meals together, and Bono played tapes\nof the songs U2 was preparing for what became the No Line on the Horizon album. But\ndespite the friendship, Jobs was still a tough negotiator. They tried to make a deal for\nanother ad and special release of the song “Get On Your Boots,” but they could not\ncome to terms. When Bono hurt his back in 2010 and had to cancel a tour, Powell sent\nhim a gift basket with a DVD of the comedy duo Flight of the Conchords, the book\nMozart’s Brain and the Fighter Pilot, honey from her beehives, and pain cream. Jobs\nwrote a note and attached it to the last item, saying, “Pain Cream—I love this stuff.”\nYo-Yo Ma\nThere was one classical musician Jobs revered both as a person and as a performer:\nYo-Yo Ma, the versatile virtuoso who is as sweet and profound as the tones he creates\non his cello. They had met in 1981, when Jobs was at the Aspen Design Conference and\nMa was at the Aspen Music Festival. Jobs tended to be deeply moved by artists who\ndisplayed purity, and he became a fan. He invited Ma to play at his wedding, but he was\nout of the country on tour. He came by the Jobs house a few years later, sat in the living\nroom, pulled out his 1733 Stradivarius cello, and played Bach. “This is what I would\nhave played for your wedding,” he told them. Jobs teared up and told him, “You playing\nis the best argument I’ve ever heard for the existence of God, because I don’t really\nbelieve a human alone can do this.” On a subsequent visit Ma allowed Jobs’s daughter\nErin to hold the cello while they sat around the kitchen. By that time Jobs had been\nstruck by cancer, and he made Ma promise to play at his funeral.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\nPIXAR’S FRIENDS\n... and Foes\nA Bug’s Life\nWhen Apple developed the iMac, Jobs drove with Jony Ive to show it to the folks at\nPixar. He felt that the machine had the spunky personality that would appeal to the\ncreators of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, and he loved the fact that Ive and John Lasseter\nshared the talent to connect art with technology in a playful way.\nPixar was a haven where Jobs could escape the intensity in Cupertino. At Apple, the\nmanagers were often excitable and exhausted, Jobs tended to be volatile, and people\nfelt nervous about where they stood with him. At Pixar, the storytellers and illustrators\nseemed more serene and behaved more gently, both with each other and even with Jobs.\nIn other words, the tone at each place was set at the top, by Jobs at Apple, but by\nLasseter at Pixar.\nJobs reveled in the earnest playfulness of moviemaking and got passionate about the\nalgorithms that enabled such magic as allowing computer-generated raindrops to refract\nsunbeams or blades of grass to wave in the wind. But he was able to restrain himself\nfrom trying to control the creative process. It was at Pixar that he learned to let other\ncreative people flourish and take the lead. Largely it was because he loved Lasseter, a\ngentle artist who, like Ive, brought out the best in Jobs.\nJobs’s main role at Pixar was deal making, in which his natural intensity was an\nasset. Soon after the release of Toy Story, he clashed with Jeffrey Katzenberg, who had\nleft Disney in the summer of 1994 and joined with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen\nto start DreamWorks SKG. Jobs believed that his Pixar team had told Katzenberg, while\nhe was still at Disney, about its proposed second movie, A Bug’s Life, and that he had\nthen stolen the idea of an animated insect movie when he decided to produce Antz at\n\nDreamWorks. “When Jeffrey was still running Disney animation, we pitched him on A\nBug’s Life,” Jobs said. “In sixty years of animation history, nobody had thought of doing\nan animated movie about insects, until Lasseter. It was one of his brilliant creative\nsparks. And Jeffrey left and went to DreamWorks and all of a sudden had this idea for\nan animated movie about—Oh!—insects. And he pretended he’d never heard the pitch.\nHe lied. He lied through his teeth.”\nActually, not. The real story is a bit more interesting. Katzenberg never heard the\nBug’s Life pitch while at Disney. But after he left for DreamWorks, he stayed in touch\nwith Lasseter, occasionally pinging him with one of his typical “Hey buddy, how you\ndoing just checking in” quick phone calls. So when Lasseter happened to be at the\nTechnicolor facility on the Universal lot, where DreamWorks was also located, he\ncalled Katzenberg and dropped by with a couple of colleagues. When Katzenberg asked\nwhat they were doing next, Lasseter told him. “We described to him A Bug’s Life, with\nan ant as the main character, and told him the whole story of him organizing the other\nants and enlisting a group of circus performer insects to fight off the grasshoppers,”\nLasseter recalled. “I should have been wary. Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it\nwould be released.”\nLasseter  began  to  get  worried  when,  in  early  1996,  he  heard  rumors  that\nDreamWorks might be making its own computer-animated movie about ants. He called\nKatzenberg and asked him point-blank. Katzenberg hemmed, hawed, and asked where\nLasseter had heard that. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true.\n“How could you?” yelled Lasseter, who very rarely raised his voice.\n“We had the idea long ago,” said Katzenberg, who explained that it had been pitched\nto him by a development director at DreamWorks.\n“I don’t believe you,” Lasseter replied.\nKatzenberg  conceded  that  he  had  sped  up Antz  as  a  way  to  counter  his  former\ncolleagues at Disney. DreamWorks’ first major picture was to be Prince  of  Egypt,\nwhich was scheduled to be released for Thanksgiving 1998, and he was appalled when\nhe heard that Disney was planning to release Pixar’s A Bug’s Life that same weekend.\nSo he had rushed Antz into production to force Disney to change the release date of A\nBug’s Life.\n“Fuck you,” replied Lasseter, who did not normally use such language. He didn’t\nspeak to Katzenberg for another thirteen years.\nJobs was furious, and he was far more practiced than Lasseter at giving vent to his\nemotions. He called Katzenberg and started yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He\nwould delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug’s Life so that it\ndidn’t compete with Prince of Egypt. “It was a blatant extortion attempt, and I didn’t go\nfor it,” Jobs recalled. He told Katzenberg there was nothing he could do to make Disney\nchange the release date.\n“Of course you can,” Katzenberg replied. “You can move mountains. You taught me\nhow!” He said that when Pixar was almost bankrupt, he had come to its rescue by giving\n\nit the deal to do Toy Story. “I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you’re\nallowing them to use you to screw me.” He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could\nsimply  slow  down  production  on A  Bug’s  Life  without  telling  Disney.  If  he  did,\nKatzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. “Don’t even go there,” Jobs replied.\nKatzenberg had a valid gripe. It was clear that Eisner and Disney were using the\nPixar movie to get back at him for leaving Disney and starting a rival animation studio.\n“Prince of Egypt was the first thing we were making, and they scheduled something for\nour announced release date just to be hostile,” he said. “My view was like that of the\nLion King, that if you stick your hand in my cage and paw me, watch out.”\nNo one backed down, and the rival ant movies provoked a press frenzy. Disney tried\nto keep Jobs quiet, on the theory that playing up the rivalry would serve to help Antz,\nbut he was a man not easily muzzled. “The bad guys rarely win,” he told the Los\nAngeles  Times.  In  response,  DreamWorks’  savvy  marketing  maven,  Terry  Press,\nsuggested, “Steve Jobs should take a pill.”\nAntz was released at the beginning of October 1998. It was not a bad movie. Woody\nAllen voiced the part of a neurotic ant living in a conformist society who yearns to\nexpress his individualism. “This is the kind of Woody Allen comedy Woody Allen no\nlonger makes,” Time wrote. It grossed a respectable $91 million domestically and $172\nmillion worldwide.\nA Bug’s Life came out six weeks later, as planned. It had a more epic plot, which\nreversed  Aesop’s  tale  of  “The  Ant  and  the  Grasshopper,”  plus  a  greater  technical\nvirtuosity,  which  allowed  such  startling  details  as  the  view  of  grass  from  a  bug’s\nvantage point. Time was much more effusive about it. “Its design work is so stellar—a\nwide-screen Eden of leaves and labyrinths populated by dozens of ugly, buggy, cuddly\ncutups—that it makes the DreamWorks film seem, by comparison, like radio,” wrote\nRichard Corliss. It did twice as well as Antz at the box office, grossing $163 million\ndomestically and $363 million worldwide. (It also beat Prince of Egypt.)\nA few years later Katzenberg ran into Jobs and tried to smooth things over. He\ninsisted that he had never heard the pitch for A Bug’s Life while at Disney; if he had, his\nsettlement  with  Disney  would  have  given  him  a  share  of  the  profits,  so  it’s  not\nsomething he would lie about. Jobs laughed, and accepted as much. “I asked you to\nmove your release date, and you wouldn’t, so you can’t be mad at me for protecting my\nchild,” Katzenberg told him. He recalled that Jobs “got really calm and Zen-like” and\nsaid he understood. But Jobs later said that he never really forgave Katzenberg:\nOur film toasted his at the box office. Did that feel good? No, it still felt awful, because\npeople started saying how everyone in Hollywood was doing insect movies. He took\nthe  brilliant  originality  away  from  John,  and  that  can  never  be  replaced.  That’s\nunconscionable, so I’ve never trusted him, even after he tried to make amends. He came\n\nup to me after he was successful with Shrek and said, “I’m a changed man, I’m finally at\npeace with myself,” and all this crap. And it was like, give me a break, Jeffrey.\nFor his part, Katzenberg was much more gracious. He considered Jobs one of the\n“true  geniuses  in  the  world,”  and  he  learned  to  respect  him  despite  their  volatile\ndealings.\nMore important than beating Antz was showing that Pixar was not a one-hit wonder.\nA Bug’s Life grossed as much as Toy Story had, proving that the first success was not a\nfluke. “There’s a classic thing in business, which is the second-product syndrome,” Jobs\nlater said. It comes from not understanding what made your first product so successful.\n“I lived through that at Apple. My feeling was, if we got through our second film, we’d\nmake it.”\nSteve’s Own Movie\nToy Story 2, which came out in November 1999, was even bigger, with a $485 million\ngross worldwide. Given that Pixar’s success was now assured, it was time to start\nbuilding  a  showcase  headquarters.  Jobs  and  the  Pixar  facilities  team  found  an\nabandoned Del Monte fruit cannery in Emeryville, an industrial neighborhood between\nBerkeley and Oakland, just across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco. They tore it\ndown, and Jobs commissioned Peter Bohlin, the architect of the Apple stores, to design\na new building for the sixteen-acre plot.\nJobs obsessed over every aspect of the new building, from the overall concept to the\ntiniest detail regarding materials and construction. “Steve had this firm belief that the\nright kind of building can do great things for a culture,” said Pixar’s president Ed\nCatmull. Jobs controlled the creation of the building as if he were a director sweating\neach scene of a film. “The Pixar building was Steve’s own movie,” Lasseter said.\nLasseter  had  originally  wanted  a  traditional  Hollywood  studio,  with  separate\nbuildings for various projects and bungalows for development teams. But the Disney\nfolks said they didn’t like their new campus because the teams felt isolated, and Jobs\nagreed. In fact he decided they should go to the other extreme: one huge building around\na central atrium designed to encourage random encounters.\nDespite being a denizen of the digital world, or maybe because he knew all too well\nits isolating potential, Jobs was a strong believer in face-to-face meetings. “There’s a\ntemptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and\niChat,”  he  said.  “That’s  crazy.  Creativity  comes  from  spontaneous  meetings,  from\nrandom discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, you say ‘Wow,’\nand soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”\n\nSo  he  had  the  Pixar  building  designed  to  promote  encounters  and  unplanned\ncollaborations. “If a building doesn’t encourage that, you’ll lose a lot of innovation and\nthe magic that’s sparked by serendipity,” he said. “So we designed the building to make\npeople get out of their offices and mingle in the central atrium with people they might\nnot otherwise see.” The front doors and main stairs and corridors all led to the atrium,\nthe café and the mailboxes were there, the conference rooms had windows that looked\nout onto it, and the six-hundred-seat theater and two smaller screening rooms all spilled\ninto it. “Steve’s theory worked from day one,” Lasseter recalled. “I kept running into\npeople I hadn’t seen for months. I’ve never seen a building that promoted collaboration\nand creativity as well as this one.”\nJobs even went so far as to decree that there be only two huge bathrooms in the\nbuilding, one for each gender, connected to the atrium. “He felt that very, very strongly,”\nrecalled Pam Kerwin, Pixar’s general manager. “Some of us felt that was going too far.\nOne pregnant woman said she shouldn’t be forced to walk for ten minutes just to go to\nthe bathroom, and that led to a big fight.” It was one of the few times that Lasseter\ndisagreed  with  Jobs.  They  reached  a  compromise:  there  would  be  two  sets  of\nbathrooms on either side of the atrium on both of the two floors.\nBecause  the  building’s  steel  beams  were  going  to  be  visible,  Jobs  pored  over\nsamples from manufacturers across the country to see which had the best color and\ntexture. He chose a mill in Arkansas, told it to blast the steel to a pure color, and made\nsure the truckers used caution not to nick any of it. He also insisted that all the beams be\nbolted together, not welded. “We sandblasted the steel and clear-coated it, so you can\nactually see what it’s like,” he recalled. “When the steelworkers were putting up the\nbeams, they would bring their families on the weekend to show them.”\nThe wackiest piece of serendipity was “The Love Lounge.” One of the animators\nfound a small door on the back wall when he moved into his office. It opened to a low\ncorridor that you could crawl through to a room clad in sheet metal that provided access\nto the air-conditioning valves. He and his colleagues commandeered the secret room,\nfestooned  it  with  Christmas  lights  and  lava  lamps,  and  furnished  it  with  benches\nupholstered in animal prints, tasseled pillows, a fold-up cocktail table, liquor bottles,\nbar equipment, and napkins that read “The Love Lounge.” A video camera installed in\nthe corridor allowed occupants to monitor who might be approaching.\nLasseter and Jobs brought important visitors there and had them sign the wall. The\nsignatures include Michael Eisner, Roy Disney, Tim Allen, and Randy Newman. Jobs\nloved it, but since he wasn’t a drinker he sometimes referred to it as the Meditation\nRoom. It reminded him, he said, of the one that he and Daniel Kottke had at Reed, but\nwithout the acid.\nThe Divorce\n\nIn testimony before a Senate committee in February 2002, Michael Eisner blasted the\nads that Jobs had created for Apple’s iTunes. “There are computer companies that have\nfull-page ads and billboards that say: Rip, mix, burn,” he declared. “In other words,\nthey can create a theft and distribute it to all their friends if they buy this particular\ncomputer.”\nThis was not a smart comment. It misunderstood the meaning of “rip” and assumed it\ninvolved ripping someone off, rather than importing files from a CD to a computer.\nMore significantly, it truly pissed off Jobs, as Eisner should have known. That too was\nnot smart. Pixar had recently released the fourth movie in its Disney deal, Monsters,\nInc., which turned out to be the most successful of them all, with $525 million in\nworldwide gross. Disney’s Pixar deal was again coming up for renewal, and Eisner had\nnot  made  it  easier  by  publicly  poking  a  stick  at  his  partner’s  eye.  Jobs  was  so\nincredulous he called a Disney executive to vent: “Do you know what Michael just did\nto me?”\nEisner and Jobs came from different backgrounds and opposite coasts, but they were\nsimilar in being strong-willed and without much inclination to find compromises. They\nboth had a passion for making good products, which often meant micromanaging details\nand  not  sugarcoating  their  criticisms.  Watching  Eisner  take  repeated  rides  on  the\nWildlife Express train through Disney World’s Animal Kingdom and coming up with\nsmart ways to improve the customer experience was like watching Jobs play with the\ninterface of an iPod and find ways it could be simplified. Watching them manage people\nwas a less edifying experience.\nBoth were better at pushing people than being pushed, which led to an unpleasant\natmosphere when they started trying to do it to each other. In a disagreement, they tended\nto assert that the other party was lying. In addition, neither Eisner nor Jobs seemed to\nbelieve that he could learn anything from the other; nor would it have occurred to either\neven to fake a bit of deference by pretending to have anything to learn. Jobs put the onus\non Eisner:\nThe  worst  thing,  to  my  mind,  was  that  Pixar  had  successfully  reinvented  Disney’s\nbusiness, turning out great films one after the other while Disney turned out flop after\nflop. You would think the CEO of Disney would be curious how Pixar was doing that.\nBut during the twenty-year relationship, he visited Pixar for a total of about two and a\nhalf hours, only to give little congratulatory speeches. He was never curious. I was\namazed. Curiosity is very important.\nThat was overly harsh. Eisner had been up to Pixar a bit more than that, including visits\nwhen Jobs wasn’t with him. But it was true that he showed little curiosity about the\n\nartistry or technology at the studio. Jobs likewise didn’t spend much time trying to learn\nfrom Disney’s management.\nThe open sniping between Jobs and Eisner began in the summer of 2002. Jobs had\nalways admired the creative spirit of the great Walt Disney, especially because he had\nnurtured  a  company  to  last  for  generations.  He  viewed  Walt’s  nephew  Roy  as  an\nembodiment  of  this  historic  legacy  and  spirit.  Roy  was  still  on  the  Disney  board,\ndespite his own growing estrangement from Eisner, and Jobs let him know that he would\nnot renew the Pixar-Disney deal as long as Eisner was still the CEO.\nRoy  Disney  and  Stanley  Gold,  his  close  associate  on  the  Disney  board,  began\nwarning other directors about the Pixar problem. That prompted Eisner to send the\nboard an intemperate email in late August 2002. He was confident that Pixar would\neventually renew its deal, he said, partly because Disney had rights to the Pixar movies\nand characters that had been made thus far. Plus, he said, Disney would be in a better\nnegotiating position in a year, after Pixar finished Finding Nemo. “Yesterday we saw\nfor the second time the new Pixar movie, Finding Nemo, that comes out next May,” he\nwrote. “This will be a reality check for those guys. It’s okay, but nowhere near as good\nas  their  previous  films.  Of  course  they  think  it  is  great.”  There  were  two  major\nproblems with this email: It leaked to the Los Angeles Times, provoking Jobs to go\nballistic, and Eisner’s assessment of the movie was wrong, very wrong.\nFinding Nemo became Pixar’s (and Disney’s) biggest hit thus far. It easily beat out\nThe Lion King to become, for the time being, the most successful animated movie in\nhistory. It grossed $340 million domestically and $868 million worldwide. Until 2010\nit was also the most popular DVD of all time, with forty million copies sold, and\nspawned some of the most popular rides at Disney theme parks. In addition, it was a\nrichly textured, subtle, and deeply beautiful artistic achievement that won the Oscar for\nbest animated feature. “I liked the film because it was about taking risks and learning to\nlet those you love take risks,” Jobs said. Its success added $183 million to Pixar’s cash\nreserves, giving it a hefty war chest of $521 million for the final showdown with\nDisney.\nShortly after Finding Nemo was finished, Jobs made Eisner an offer that was so\none-sided it was clearly meant to be rejected. Instead of a fifty-fifty split on revenues,\nas in the existing deal, Jobs proposed a new arrangement in which Pixar would own\noutright the films it made and the characters in them, and it would merely pay Disney a\n7.5% fee to distribute the movies. Plus, the last two films under the existing deal—The\nIncredibles and Cars were the ones in the works—would shift to the new distribution\ndeal.\nEisner, however, held one powerful trump card. Even if Pixar didn’t renew, Disney\nhad the right to make sequels of Toy Story and the other movies that Pixar had made, and\nit owned all the characters, from Woody to Nemo, just as it owned Mickey Mouse and\nDonald  Duck.  Eisner  was  already  planning—or  threatening—to  have  Disney’s  own\nanimation studio do a Toy Story 3, which Pixar had declined to do. “When you see what\n\nthat company did putting out Cinderella II, you shudder at what would have happened,”\nJobs said.\nEisner was able to force Roy Disney off the board in November 2003, but that didn’t\nend the turmoil. Disney released a scathing open letter. “The company has lost its focus,\nits creative energy, and its heritage,” he wrote. His litany of Eisner’s alleged failings\nincluded not building a constructive relationship with Pixar. By this point Jobs had\ndecided that he no longer wanted to work with Eisner. So in January 2004 he publicly\nannounced that he was cutting off negotiations with Disney.\nJobs was usually disciplined in not making public the strong opinions that he shared\nwith friends around his Palo Alto kitchen table. But this time he did not hold back. In a\nconference call with reporters, he said that while Pixar was producing hits, Disney\nanimation was making “embarrassing duds.” He scoffed at Eisner’s notion that Disney\nmade any creative contribution to the Pixar films: “The truth is there has been little\ncreative collaboration with Disney for years. You can compare the creative quality of\nour films with the creative quality of Disney’s last three films and judge each company’s\ncreative ability yourselves.” In addition to building a better creative team, Jobs had\npulled off the remarkable feat of building a brand that was now as big a draw for\nmoviegoers  as  Disney’s.  “We  think  the  Pixar  brand  is  now  the  most  powerful  and\ntrusted brand in animation.” When Jobs called to give him a heads-up, Roy Disney\nreplied, “When the wicked witch is dead, we’ll be together again.”\nJohn Lasseter was aghast at the prospect of breaking up with Disney. “I was worried\nabout my children, what they would do with the characters we’d created,” he recalled.\n“It was like a dagger to my heart.” When he told his top staff in the Pixar conference\nroom, he started crying, and he did so again when he addressed the eight hundred or so\nPixar employees gathered in the studio’s atrium. “It’s like you have these dear children\nand you have to give them up to be adopted by convicted child molesters.” Jobs came to\nthe atrium stage next and tried to calm things down. He explained why it might be\nnecessary to break with Disney, and he assured them that Pixar as an institution had to\nkeep  looking  forward  to  be  successful.  “He  has  the  absolute  ability  to  make  you\nbelieve,” said Oren Jacob, a longtime technologist at the studio. “Suddenly, we all had\nthe confidence that, whatever happened, Pixar would flourish.”\nBob Iger, Disney’s chief operating officer, had to step in and do damage control. He\nwas as sensible and solid as those around him were volatile. His background was in\ntelevision; he had been president of the ABC Network, which was acquired in 1996 by\nDisney. His reputation was as a corporate suit, and he excelled at deft management, but\nhe also had a sharp eye for talent, a good-humored ability to understand people, and a\nquiet flair that he was secure enough to keep muted. Unlike Eisner and Jobs, he had a\ndisciplined  calm,  which  helped  him  deal  with  large  egos.  “Steve  did  some\ngrandstanding by announcing that he was ending talks with us,” Iger later recalled. “We\nwent into crisis mode, and I developed some talking points to settle things down.”\n\nEisner had presided over ten great years at Disney, when Frank Wells served as his\npresident.  Wells  freed  Eisner  from  many  management  duties  so  he  could  make  his\nsuggestions,  usually  valuable  and  often  brilliant,  on  ways  to  improve  each  movie\nproject, theme park ride, television pilot, and countless other products. But after Wells\nwas  killed  in  a  helicopter  crash  in  1994,  Eisner  never  found  the  right  manager.\nKatzenberg had demanded Wells’s job, which is why Eisner ousted him. Michael Ovitz\nbecame president in 1995; it was not a pretty sight, and he was gone in less than two\nyears. Jobs later offered his assessment:\nFor his first ten years as CEO, Eisner did a really good job. For the last ten years, he\nreally did a bad job. And the change came when Frank Wells died. Eisner is a really\ngood creative guy. He gives really good notes. So when Frank was running operations,\nEisner could be like a bumblebee going from project to project trying to make them\nbetter. But when Eisner had to run things, he was a terrible manager. Nobody liked\nworking for him. They felt they had no authority. He had this strategic planning group\nthat was like the Gestapo, in that you couldn’t spend any money, not even a dime,\nwithout  them  approving  it.  Even  though  I  broke  with  him,  I  had  to  respect  his\nachievements in the first ten years. And there was a part of him I actually liked. He’s a\nfun guy to be around at times—smart, witty. But he had a dark side to him. His ego got\nthe better of him. Eisner was reasonable and fair to me at first, but eventually, over the\ncourse of dealing with him for a decade, I came to see a dark side to him.\nEisner’s biggest problem in 2004 was that he did not fully fathom how messed up his\nanimation division was. Its two most recent movies, Treasure Planet and Brother Bear,\ndid no honor to the Disney legacy, or to its balance sheets. Hit animation movies were\nthe  lifeblood  of  the  company;  they  spawned  theme  park  rides,  toys,  and  television\nshows. Toy Story had led to a movie sequel, a Disney on Ice show, a Toy Story Musical\nperformed on Disney cruise ships, a direct-to-video film featuring Buzz Lightyear, a\ncomputer storybook, two video games, a dozen action toys that sold twenty-five million\nunits, a clothing line, and nine different attractions at Disney theme parks. This was not\nthe case for Treasure Planet.\n“Michael didn’t understand that Disney’s problems in animation were as acute as\nthey were,” Iger later explained. “That manifested itself in the way he dealt with Pixar.\nHe never felt he needed Pixar as much as he really did.” In addition, Eisner loved to\nnegotiate and hated to compromise, which was not always the best combination when\ndealing with Jobs, who was the same way. “Every negotiation needs to be resolved by\ncompromises,” Iger said. “Neither one of them is a master of compromise.”\nThe impasse was ended on a Saturday night in March 2005, when Iger got a phone\ncall from former senator George Mitchell and other Disney board members. They told\n\nhim that, starting in a few months, he would replace Eisner as Disney’s CEO. When Iger\ngot up the next morning, he called his daughters and then Steve Jobs and John Lasseter.\nHe said, very simply and clearly, that he valued Pixar and wanted to make a deal. Jobs\nwas thrilled. He liked Iger and even marveled at a small connection they had: his\nformer girlfriend Jennifer Egan and Iger’s wife, Willow Bay, had been roommates at\nPenn.\nThat summer, before Iger officially took over, he and Jobs got to have a trial run at\nmaking a deal. Apple was coming out with an iPod that would play video as well as\nmusic. It needed television shows to sell, and Jobs did not want to be too public in\nnegotiating for them because, as usual, he wanted the product to be secret until he\nunveiled it onstage. Iger, who had multiple iPods and used them throughout the day, from\nhis 5 a.m. workouts to late at night, had already been envisioning what it could do for\ntelevision shows. So he immediately offered ABC’s most popular shows, Desperate\nHousewives and Lost. “We negotiated that deal in a week, and it was complicated,” Iger\nsaid. “It was important because Steve got to see how I worked, and because it showed\neveryone that Disney could in fact work with Steve.”\nFor the announcement of the video iPod, Jobs rented a theater in San Jose, and he\ninvited  Iger  to  be  his  surprise  guest  onstage.  “I  had  never  been  to  one  of  his\nannouncements, so I had no idea what a big deal it was,” Iger recalled. “It was a real\nbreakthrough for our relationship. He saw I was pro-technology and willing to take\nrisks.” Jobs did his usual virtuoso performance, running through all the features of the\nnew iPod, how it was “one of the best things we’ve ever done,” and how the iTunes\nStore would now be selling music videos and short films. Then, as was his habit, he\nended with “And yes, there is one more thing:” The iPod would be selling TV shows.\nThere was huge applause. He mentioned that the two most popular shows were on\nABC. “And who owns ABC? Disney! I know these guys,” he exulted.\nWhen Iger then came onstage, he looked as relaxed and as comfortable as Jobs.\n“One of the things that Steve and I are incredibly excited about is the intersection\nbetween great content and great technology,” he said. “It’s great to be here to announce\nan extension of our relation with Apple,” he added. Then, after the proper pause, he\nsaid, “Not with Pixar, but with Apple.”\nBut it was clear from their warm embrace that a new Pixar-Disney deal was once\nagain possible. “It signaled my way of operating, which was ‘Make love not war,’” Iger\nrecalled. “We had been at war with Roy Disney, Comcast, Apple, and Pixar. I wanted to\nfix all that, Pixar most of all.”\nIger had just come back from opening the new Disneyland in Hong Kong, with\nEisner at his side in his last big act as CEO. The ceremonies included the usual Disney\nparade down Main Street. Iger realized that the only characters in the parade that had\nbeen created in the past decade were Pixar’s. “A lightbulb went off,” he recalled. “I’m\nstanding next to Michael, but I kept it completely to myself, because it was such an\n\nindictment of his stewardship of animation during that period. After ten years of The\nLion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, there were then ten years of nothing.”\nIger went back to Burbank and had some financial analysis done. He discovered that\nthey had actually lost money on animation in the past decade and had produced little that\nhelped  ancillary  products.  At  his  first  meeting  as  the  new  CEO,  he  presented  the\nanalysis to the board, whose members expressed some anger that they had never been\ntold this. “As animation goes, so goes our company,” he told the board. “A hit animated\nfilm  is  a  big  wave,  and  the  ripples  go  down  to  every  part  of  our  business—from\ncharacters  in  a  parade,  to  music,  to  parks,  to  video  games,  TV,  Internet,  consumer\nproducts.  If  I  don’t  have  wave  makers,  the  company  is  not  going  to  succeed.”  He\npresented  them  with  some  choices.  They  could  stick  with  the  current  animation\nmanagement, which he didn’t think would work. They could get rid of management and\nfind someone else, but he said he didn’t know who that would be. Or they could buy\nPixar. “The problem is, I don’t know if it’s for sale, and if it is, it’s going to be a huge\namount of money,” he said. The board authorized him to explore a deal.\nIger went about it in an unusual way. When he first talked to Jobs, he admitted the\nrevelation that had occurred to him in Hong Kong and how it convinced him that Disney\nbadly needed Pixar. “That’s why I just loved Bob Iger,” recalled Jobs. “He just blurted\nit out. Now that’s the dumbest thing you can do as you enter a negotiation, at least\naccording to the traditional rule book. He just put his cards out on the table and said,\n‘We’re screwed.’ I immediately liked the guy, because that’s how I worked too. Let’s\njust immediately put all the cards on the table and see where they fall.” (In fact that was\nnot usually Jobs’s mode of operation. He often began negotiations by proclaiming that\nthe other company’s products or services sucked.)\nJobs and Iger took a lot of walks—around the Apple campus, in Palo Alto, at the\nAllen  and  Co.  retreat  in  Sun  Valley.  At  first  they  came  up  with  a  plan  for  a  new\ndistribution deal: Pixar would get back all the rights to the movies and characters it had\nalready produced in return for Disney’s getting an equity stake in Pixar, and it would\npay Disney a simple fee to distribute its future movies. But Iger worried that such a deal\nwould simply set Pixar up as a competitor to Disney, which would be bad even if\nDisney had an equity stake in it. So he began to hint that maybe they should actually do\nsomething bigger. “I want you to know that I am really thinking out of the box on this,”\nhe said. Jobs seemed to encourage the advances. “It wasn’t too long before it was clear\nto both of us that this discussion might lead to an acquisition discussion,” Jobs recalled.\nBut first Jobs needed the blessing of John Lasseter and Ed Catmull, so he asked them\nto come over to his house. He got right to the point. “We need to get to know Bob Iger,”\nhe told them. “We may want to throw in with him and to help him remake Disney. He’s a\ngreat  guy.”  They  were  skeptical  at  first.  “He  could  tell  we  were  pretty  shocked,”\nLasseter recalled.\n“If you guys don’t want to do it, that’s fine, but I want you to get to know Iger before\nyou decide,” Jobs continued. “I was feeling the same as you, but I’ve really grown to\n\nlike the guy.” He explained how easy it had been to make the deal to put ABC shows on\nthe  iPod,  and  added,  “It’s  night  and  day  different  from  Eisner’s  Disney.  He’s\nstraightforward,  and  there’s  no  drama  with  him.”  Lasseter  remembers  that  he  and\nCatmull just sat there with their mouths slightly open.\nIger went to work. He flew from Los Angeles to Lasseter’s house for dinner, and\nstayed up well past midnight talking. He also took Catmull out to dinner, and then he\nvisited Pixar Studios, alone, with no entourage and without Jobs. “I went out and met all\nthe directors one on one, and they each pitched me their movie,” he said. Lasseter was\nproud of how much his team impressed Iger, which of course made him warm up to Iger.\n“I never had more pride in Pixar than that day,” he said. “All the teams and pitches were\namazing, and Bob was blown away.”\nIndeed after seeing what was coming up over the next few years—Cars, Ratatouille,\nWALL-E—Iger told his chief financial officer at Disney, “Oh my God, they’ve got great\nstuff. We’ve got to get this deal done. It’s the future of the company.” He admitted that he\nhad no faith in the movies that Disney animation had in the works.\nThe deal they proposed was that Disney would purchase Pixar for $7.4 billion in\nstock. Jobs would thus become Disney’s largest shareholder, with approximately 7% of\nthe  company’s  stock  compared  to  1.7%  owned  by  Eisner  and  1%  by  Roy  Disney.\nDisney Animation would be put under Pixar, with Lasseter and Catmull running the\ncombined unit. Pixar would retain its independent identity, its studio and headquarters\nwould remain in Emeryville, and it would even keep its own email addresses.\nIger asked Jobs to bring Lasseter and Catmull to a secret meeting of the Disney\nboard in Century City, Los Angeles, on a Sunday morning. The goal was to make them\nfeel comfortable with what would be a radical and expensive deal. As they prepared to\ntake the elevator from the parking garage, Lasseter said to Jobs, “If I start getting too\nexcited or go on too long, just touch my leg.” Jobs ended up having to do it once, but\notherwise Lasseter made the perfect sales pitch. “I talked about how we make films,\nwhat our philosophies are, the honesty we have with each other, and how we nurture the\ncreative talent,” he recalled. The board asked a lot of questions, and Jobs let Lasseter\nanswer most. But Jobs did talk about how exciting it was to connect art with technology.\n“That’s what our culture is all about, just like at Apple,” he said.\nBefore the Disney board got a chance to approve the merger, however, Michael\nEisner arose from the departed to try to derail it. He called Iger and said it was far too\nexpensive. “You can fix animation yourself,” Eisner told him. “How?” asked Iger. “I\nknow you can,” said Eisner. Iger got a bit annoyed. “Michael, how come you say I can\nfix it, when you couldn’t fix it yourself?” he asked.\nEisner said he wanted to come to a board meeting, even though he was no longer a\nmember or an officer, and speak against the acquisition. Iger resisted, but Eisner called\nWarren Buffett, a big shareholder, and George Mitchell, who was the lead director. The\nformer senator convinced Iger to let Eisner have his say. “I told the board that they\ndidn’t need to buy Pixar because they already owned 85% of the movies Pixar had\n\nalready  made,”  Eisner  recounted.  He  was  referring  to  the  fact  that  for  the  movies\nalready made, Disney was getting that percentage of the gross, plus it had the rights to\nmake all the sequels and exploit the characters. “I made a presentation that said, here’s\nthe 15% of Pixar that Disney does not already own. So that’s what you’re getting. The\nrest is a bet on future Pixar films.” Eisner admitted that Pixar had been enjoying a good\nrun, but he said it could not continue. “I showed the history of producers and directors\nwho had X number of hits in a row and then failed. It happened to Spielberg, Walt\nDisney, all of them.” To make the deal worth it, he calculated, each new Pixar movie\nwould have to gross $1.3 billion. “It drove Steve crazy that I knew that,” Eisner later\nsaid.\nAfter he left the room, Iger refuted his argument point by point. “Let me tell you what\nwas wrong with that presentation,” he began. When the board had finished hearing them\nboth, it approved the deal Iger proposed.\nIger flew up to Emeryville to meet Jobs and jointly announce the deal to the Pixar\nworkers. But before they did, Jobs sat down alone with Lasseter and Catmull. “If either\nof you have doubts,” he said, “I will just tell them no thanks and blow off this deal.” He\nwasn’t totally sincere. It would have been almost impossible to do so at that point. But\nit was a welcome gesture. “I’m good,” said Lasseter. “Let’s do it.” Catmull agreed.\nThey all hugged, and Jobs wept.\nEveryone then gathered in the atrium. “Disney is buying Pixar,” Jobs announced.\nThere were a few tears, but as he explained the deal, the staffers began to realize that in\nsome  ways  it  was  a  reverse  acquisition.  Catmull  would  be  the  head  of  Disney\nanimation, Lasseter its chief creative officer. By the end they were cheering. Iger had\nbeen standing on the side, and Jobs invited him to center stage. As he talked about the\nspecial culture of Pixar and how badly Disney needed to nurture it and learn from it, the\ncrowd broke into applause.\n“My  goal  has  always  been  not  only  to  make  great  products,  but  to  build  great\ncompanies,” Jobs later said. “Walt Disney did that. And the way we did the merger, we\nkept Pixar as a great company and helped Disney remain one as well.”\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\nTWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY MACS\nSetting Apple Apart\nWith the iBook, 1999\nClams, Ice Cubes, and Sunflowers\nEver since the introduction of the iMac in 1998, Jobs and Jony Ive had made beguiling\ndesign a signature of Apple’s computers. There was a consumer laptop that looked like\na tangerine clam, and a professional desktop computer that suggested a Zen ice cube.\nLike bell-bottoms that turn up in the back of a closet, some of these models looked\nbetter at the time than they do in retrospect, and they show a love of design that was, on\noccasion, a bit too exuberant. But they set Apple apart and provided the publicity bursts\nit needed to survive in a Windows world.\n\nThe Power Mac G4 Cube, released in 2000, was so alluring that one ended up on\ndisplay in New York’s Museum of Modern Art. An eight-inch perfect cube the size of a\nKleenex box, it was the pure expression of Jobs’s aesthetic. The sophistication came\nfrom minimalism. No buttons marred the surface. There was no CD tray, just a subtle\nslot. And as with the original Macintosh, there was no fan. Pure Zen. “When you see\nsomething  that’s  so  thoughtful  on  the  outside  you  say,  ‘Oh,  wow,  it  must  be  really\nthoughtful on the inside,’” he told Newsweek. “We make progress by eliminating things,\nby removing the superfluous.”\nThe G4 Cube was almost ostentatious in its lack of ostentation, and it was powerful.\nBut it was not a success. It had been designed as a high-end desktop, but Jobs wanted to\nturn it, as he did almost every product, into something that could be mass-marketed to\nconsumers. The Cube ended up not serving either market well. Workaday professionals\nweren’t  seeking  a  jewel-like  sculpture  for  their  desks,  and  mass-market  consumers\nwere  not  eager  to  spend  twice  what  they’d  pay  for  a  plain  vanilla  desktop.  Jobs\npredicted that Apple would sell 200,000 Cubes per quarter. In its first quarter it sold\nhalf that. The next quarter it sold fewer than thirty thousand units. Jobs later admitted\nthat he had overdesigned and overpriced the Cube, just as he had the NeXT computer.\nBut gradually he was learning his lesson. In building devices like the iPod, he would\ncontrol costs and make the tradeoffs necessary to get them launched on time and on\nbudget.\nPartly because of the poor sales of the Cube, Apple produced disappointing revenue\nnumbers in September 2000. That was just when the tech bubble was deflating and\nApple’s education market was declining. The company’s stock price, which had been\nabove $60, fell 50% in one day, and by early December it was below $15.\nNone of this deterred Jobs from continuing to push for distinctive, even distracting,\nnew design. When flat-screen displays became commercially viable, he decided it was\ntime to replace the iMac, the translucent consumer desktop computer that looked as if it\nwere  from  a Jetsons  cartoon.  Ive  came  up  with  a  model  that  was  somewhat\nconventional, with the guts of the computer attached to the back of the flat screen. Jobs\ndidn’t like it. As he often did, both at Pixar and at Apple, he slammed on the brakes to\nrethink things. There was something about the design that lacked purity, he felt. “Why\nhave this flat display if you’re going to glom all this stuff on its back?” he asked Ive.\n“We should let each element be true to itself.”\nJobs went home early that day to mull over the problem, then called Ive to come by.\nThey wandered into the garden, which Jobs’s wife had planted with a profusion of\nsunflowers. “Every year I do something wild with the garden, and that time it involved\nmasses of sunflowers, with a sunflower house for the kids,” she recalled. “Jony and\nSteve were riffing on their design problem, then Jony asked, ‘What if the screen was\nseparated from the base like a sunflower?’ He got excited and started sketching.” Ive\nliked his designs to suggest a narrative, and he realized that a sunflower shape would\nconvey that the flat screen was so fluid and responsive that it could reach for the sun.\n\nIn Ive’s new design, the Mac’s screen was attached to a movable chrome neck, so\nthat it looked not only like a sunflower but also like a cheeky Luxo lamp. Indeed it\nevoked the playful personality of Luxo Jr. in the first short film that John Lasseter had\nmade at Pixar. Apple took out many patents for the design, most crediting Ive, but on one\nof them, for “a computer system having a movable assembly attached to a flat panel\ndisplay,” Jobs listed himself as the primary inventor.\nIn hindsight, some of Apple’s Macintosh designs may seem a bit too cute. But other\ncomputer makers were at the other extreme. It was an industry that you’d expect to be\ninnovative, but instead it was dominated by cheaply designed generic boxes. After a\nfew ill-conceived stabs at painting on blue colors and trying new shapes, companies\nsuch as Dell, Compaq, and HP commoditized computers by outsourcing manufacturing\nand competing on price. With its spunky designs and its pathbreaking applications like\niTunes and iMovie, Apple was about the only place innovating.\nIntel Inside\nApple’s  innovations  were  more  than  skin-deep.  Since  1994  it  had  been  using  a\nmicroprocessor,  called  the  PowerPC,  that  was  made  by  a  partnership  of  IBM  and\nMotorola. For a few years it was faster than Intel’s chips, an advantage that Apple\ntouted in humorous commercials. By the time of Jobs’s return, however, Motorola had\nfallen behind in producing new versions of the chip. This provoked a fight between\nJobs  and  Motorola’s  CEO  Chris  Galvin.  When  Jobs  decided  to  stop  licensing  the\nMacintosh operating system to clone makers, right after his return to Apple in 1997, he\nsuggested to Galvin that he might consider making an exception for Motorola’s clone,\nthe StarMax Mac, but only if Motorola sped up development of new PowerPC chips for\nlaptops.  The  call  got  heated.  Jobs  offered  his  opinion  that  Motorola  chips  sucked.\nGalvin, who also had a temper, pushed back. Jobs hung up on him. The Motorola\nStarMax  was  canceled,  and  Jobs  secretly  began  planning  to  move  Apple  off  the\nMotorola-IBM PowerPC chip and to adopt, instead, Intel’s. This would not be a simple\ntask. It was akin to writing a new operating system.\nJobs did not cede any real power to his board, but he did use its meetings to kick\naround ideas and think through strategies in confidence, while he stood at a whiteboard\nand led freewheeling discussions. For eighteen months the directors discussed whether\nto move to an Intel architecture. “We debated it, we asked a lot of questions, and finally\nwe all decided it needed to be done,” board member Art Levinson recalled.\nPaul  Otellini,  who  was  then  president  and  later  became  CEO  of  Intel,  began\nhuddling with Jobs. They had gotten to know each other when Jobs was struggling to\nkeep NeXT alive and, as Otellini later put it, “his arrogance had been temporarily\ntempered.” Otellini has a calm and wry take on people, and he was amused rather than\n\nput off when he discovered, upon dealing with Jobs at Apple in the early 2000s, “that\nhis juices were going again, and he wasn’t nearly as humble anymore.” Intel had deals\nwith other computer makers, and Jobs wanted a better price than they had. “We had to\nfind creative ways to bridge the numbers,” said Otellini. Most of the negotiating was\ndone, as Jobs preferred, on long walks, sometimes on the trails up to the radio telescope\nknown as the Dish above the Stanford campus. Jobs would start the walk by telling a\nstory and explaining how he saw the history of computers evolving. By the end he\nwould be haggling over price.\n“Intel had a reputation for being a tough partner, coming out of the days when it was\nrun by Andy Grove and Craig Barrett,” Otellini said. “I wanted to show that Intel was a\ncompany you could work with.” So a crack team from Intel worked with Apple, and\nthey were able to beat the conversion deadline by six months. Jobs invited Otellini to\nApple’s Top 100 management retreat, where he donned one of the famous Intel lab coats\nthat looked like a bunny suit and gave Jobs a big hug. At the public announcement in\n2005, the usually reserved Otellini repeated the act. “Apple and Intel, together at last,”\nflashed on the big screen.\nBill Gates was amazed. Designing crazy-colored cases did not impress him, but a\nsecret program to switch the CPU in a computer, completed seamlessly and on time,\nwas  a  feat  he  truly  admired.  “If  you’d  said,  ‘Okay,  we’re  going  to  change  our\nmicroprocessor chip, and we’re not going to lose a beat,’ that sounds impossible,” he\ntold me years later, when I asked him about Jobs’s accomplishments. “They basically\ndid that.”\nOptions\nAmong Jobs’s quirks was his attitude toward money. When he returned to Apple in\n1997, he portrayed himself as a person working for $1 a year, doing it for the benefit of\nthe  company  rather  than  himself.  Nevertheless  he  embraced  the  idea  of  option\nmegagrants—granting huge bundles of options to buy Apple stock at a preset price—that\nwere not subject to the usual good compensation practices of board committee reviews\nand performance criteria.\nWhen he dropped the “interim” in his title and officially became CEO, he was\noffered (in addition to the airplane) a megagrant by Ed Woolard and the board at the\nbeginning of 2000; defying the image he cultivated of not being interested in money, he\nhad stunned Woolard by asking for even more options than the board had proposed. But\nsoon after he got them, it turned out that it was for naught. Apple stock cratered in\nSeptember  2000—due  to  disappointing  sales  of  the  Cube  plus  the  bursting  of  the\nInternet bubble—which made the options worthless.\n\nMaking  matters  worse  was  a  June  2001  cover  story  in Fortune  about\novercompensated CEOs, “The Great CEO Pay Heist.” A mug of Jobs, smiling smugly,\nfilled the cover. Even though his options were underwater at the time, the technical\nmethod of valuing them when granted (known as a Black-Scholes valuation) set their\nworth at $872 million. Fortune proclaimed it “by far” the largest compensation package\never granted a CEO. It was the worst of all worlds: Jobs had almost no money that he\ncould put in his pocket for his four years of hard and successful turnaround work at\nApple,  yet  he  had  become  the  poster  child  of  greedy  CEOs,  making  him  look\nhypocritical and undermining his self-image. He wrote a scathing letter to the editor,\ndeclaring that his options actually “are worth zero” and offering to sell them to Fortune\nfor half of the supposed $872 million the magazine had reported.\nIn the meantime Jobs wanted the board to give him another big grant of options,\nsince his old ones seemed worthless. He insisted, both to the board and probably to\nhimself, that it was more about getting proper recognition than getting rich. “It wasn’t so\nmuch about the money,” he later said in a deposition in an SEC lawsuit over the options.\n“Everybody likes to be recognized by his peers. ... I felt that the board wasn’t really\ndoing the same with me.” He felt that the board should have come to him offering a new\ngrant, without his having to suggest it. “I thought I was doing a pretty good job. It would\nhave made me feel better at the time.”\nHis handpicked board in fact doted on him. So they decided to give him another huge\ngrant in August 2001, when the stock price was just under $18. The problem was that he\nworried about his image, especially after the Fortune article. He did not want to accept\nthe new grant unless the board canceled his old options at the same time. But to do so\nwould have adverse accounting implications, because it would be effectively repricing\nthe old options. That would require taking a charge against current earnings. The only\nway to avoid this “variable accounting” problem was to cancel his old options at least\nsix months after his new options were granted. In addition, Jobs started haggling with\nthe board over how quickly the new options would vest.\nIt was not until mid-December 2001 that Jobs finally agreed to take the new options\nand, braving the optics, wait six months before his old ones were canceled. But by then\nthe stock price (adjusting for a split) had gone up $3, to about $21. If the strike price of\nthe new options was set at that new level, each would have thus been $3 less valuable.\nSo  Apple’s  legal  counsel,  Nancy  Heinen,  looked  over  the  recent  stock  prices  and\nhelped to choose an October date, when the stock was $18.30. She also approved a set\nof minutes that purported to show that the board had approved the grant on that date. The\nbackdating was potentially worth $20 million to Jobs.\nOnce again Jobs would end up suffering bad publicity without making a penny.\nApple’s stock price kept dropping, and by March 2003 even the new options were so\nlow that Jobs traded in all of them for an outright grant of $75 million worth of shares,\nwhich amounted to about $8.3 million for each year he had worked since coming back\nin 1997 through the end of the vesting in 2006.\n\nNone of this would have mattered much if the Wall Street Journal had not run a\npowerful series in 2006 about backdated stock options. Apple wasn’t mentioned, but its\nboard appointed a committee of three members—Al Gore, Eric Schmidt of Google, and\nJerry  York,  formerly  of  IBM  and  Chrysler—to  investigate  its  own  practices.  “We\ndecided at the outset that if Steve was at fault we would let the chips fall where they\nmay,” Gore recalled. The committee uncovered some irregularities with Jobs’s grants\nand those of other top officers, and it immediately turned the findings over to the SEC.\nJobs was aware of the backdating, the report said, but he ended up not benefiting\nfinancially.  (A  board  committee  at  Disney  also  found  that  similar  backdating  had\noccurred at Pixar when Jobs was in charge.)\nThe laws governing such backdating practices were murky, especially since no one\nat Apple ended up benefiting from the dubiously dated grants. The SEC took eight\nmonths to do its own investigation, and in April 2007 it announced that it would not\nbring action against Apple “based in part on its swift, extensive, and extraordinary\ncooperation  in  the  Commission’s  investigation  [and  its]  prompt  self-reporting.”\nAlthough the SEC found that Jobs had been aware of the backdating, it cleared him of\nany misconduct because he “was unaware of the accounting implications.”\nThe SEC did file complaints against Apple’s former chief financial officer Fred\nAnderson, who was on the board, and general counsel Nancy Heinen. Anderson, a\nretired Air Force captain with a square jaw and deep integrity, had been a wise and\ncalming  influence  at  Apple,  where  he  was  known  for  his  ability  to  control  Jobs’s\ntantrums. He was cited by the SEC only for “negligence” regarding the paperwork for\none set of the grants (not the ones that went to Jobs), and the SEC allowed him to\ncontinue to serve on corporate boards. Nevertheless he ended up resigning from the\nApple board.\nAnderson thought he had been made a scapegoat. When he settled with the SEC, his\nlawyer issued a statement that cast some of the blame on Jobs. It said that Anderson had\n“cautioned Mr. Jobs that the executive team grant would have to be priced on the date of\nthe actual board agreement or there could be an accounting charge,” and that Jobs\nreplied “that the board had given its prior approval.”\nHeinen,  who  initially  fought  the  charges  against  her,  ended  up  settling  without\nadmitting liability and paying a $2.2 million fine. Likewise the company itself settled a\nshareholders’ lawsuit by agreeing to pay $14 million in damages.\n“Rarely have so many avoidable problems been created by one man’s obsession\nwith his own image,” Joe Nocera wrote in the New York Times. “Then again, this is\nSteve Jobs we’re talking about.” Contemptuous of rules and regulations, he created a\nclimate that made it hard for someone like Heinen to buck his wishes. At times, great\ncreativity occurred. But people around him could pay a price. On compensation issues\nin particular, the difficulty of defying his whims drove some good people to make some\nbad mistakes.\n\nThe compensation issue in some ways echoed Jobs’s parking quirk. He refused such\ntrappings as having a “Reserved for CEO” spot, but he assumed for himself the right to\npark in the handicapped spaces. He wanted to be seen (both by himself and by others)\nas someone willing to work for $1 a year, but he also wanted to have huge stock grants\nbestowed upon him. Jangling inside him were the contradictions of a counterculture\nrebel turned business entrepreneur, someone who wanted to believe that he had turned\non and tuned in without having sold out and cashed in.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\nROUND ONE\nMemento Mori\nAt fifty (in center), with Eve and Laurene (behind cake), Eddy Cue (by window), John\nLasseter (with camera), and Lee Clow (with beard)\nCancer\nJobs would later speculate that his cancer was caused by the grueling year that he spent,\nstarting in 1997, running both Apple and Pixar. As he drove back and forth, he had\ndeveloped kidney stones and other ailments, and he would come home so exhausted that\nhe could barely speak. “That’s probably when this cancer started growing, because my\nimmune system was pretty weak at that time,” he said.\nThere  is  no  evidence  that  exhaustion  or  a  weak  immune  system  causes  cancer.\nHowever, his kidney problems did indirectly lead to the detection of his cancer. In\n\nOctober 2003 he happened to run into the urologist who had treated him, and she asked\nhim to get a CAT scan of his kidneys and ureter. It had been five years since his last\nscan. The new scan revealed nothing wrong with his kidneys, but it did show a shadow\non his pancreas, so she asked him to schedule a pancreatic study. He didn’t. As usual,\nhe  was  good  at  willfully  ignoring  inputs  that  he  did  not  want  to  process.  But  she\npersisted. “Steve, this is really important,” she said a few days later. “You need to do\nthis.”\nHer tone  of  voice  was  urgent  enough  that  he  complied.  He  went  in  early  one\nmorning, and after studying the scan, the doctors met with him to deliver the bad news\nthat it was a tumor. One of them even suggested that he should make sure his affairs\nwere in order, a polite way of saying that he might have only months to live. That\nevening they performed a biopsy by sticking an endoscope down his throat and into his\nintestines so they could put a needle into his pancreas and get a few cells from the\ntumor. Powell remembers her husband’s doctors tearing up with joy. It turned out to be\nan islet cell or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which is rare but slower growing and\nthus more likely to be treated successfully. He was lucky that it was detected so early—\nas the by-product of a routine kidney screening—and thus could be surgically removed\nbefore it had definitely spread.\nOne of his first calls was to Larry Brilliant, whom he first met at the ashram in India.\n“Do you still believe in God?” Jobs asked him. Brilliant said that he did, and they\ndiscussed the many paths to God that had been taught by the Hindu guru Neem Karoli\nBaba. Then Brilliant asked Jobs what was wrong. “I have cancer,” Jobs replied.\nArt Levinson, who was on Apple’s board, was chairing the board meeting of his\nown company, Genentech, when his cell phone rang and Jobs’s name appeared on the\nscreen. As soon as there was a break, Levinson called him back and heard the news of\nthe tumor. He had a background in cancer biology, and his firm made cancer treatment\ndrugs, so he became an advisor. So did Andy Grove of Intel, who had fought and beaten\nprostate cancer. Jobs called him that Sunday, and he drove right over to Jobs’s house\nand stayed for two hours.\nTo the horror of his friends and wife, Jobs decided not to have surgery to remove the\ntumor, which was the only accepted medical approach. “I really didn’t want them to\nopen up my body, so I tried to see if a few other things would work,” he told me years\nlater  with  a  hint  of  regret.  Specifically,  he  kept  to  a  strict  vegan  diet,  with  large\nquantities of fresh carrot and fruit juices. To that regimen he added acupuncture, a\nvariety of herbal remedies, and occasionally a few other treatments he found on the\nInternet or by consulting people around the country, including a psychic. For a while he\nwas under the sway of a herbal therapist who operated a natural healing clinic in\nsouthern California that stressed the use of organic herbs, juice fasts, frequent bowel\ncleansings, hydrotherapy, and the expression of all negative feelings.\n“The big thing was that he really was not ready to open his body,” Powell recalled.\n“It’s hard to push someone to do that.” She did try, however. “The body exists to serve\n\nthe  spirit,”  she  argued.  His  friends  repeatedly  urged  him  to  have  surgery  and\nchemotherapy.  “Steve  talked  to  me  when  he  was  trying  to  cure  himself  by  eating\nhorseshit and horseshit roots, and I told him he was crazy,” Grove recalled. Levinson\nsaid that he “pleaded every day” with Jobs and found it “enormously frustrating that I\njust couldn’t connect with him.” The fights almost ruined their friendship. “That’s not\nhow cancer works,” Levinson insisted when Jobs discussed his diet treatments. “You\ncannot solve this without surgery and blasting it with toxic chemicals.” Even Dr Dean\nOrnish, a pioneer in alternative and nutritional methods of treating diseases, took a long\nwalk with Jobs and insisted that sometimes traditional methods were the right option.\n“You really need surgery,” Ornish told him.\nJobs’s obstinacy lasted for nine months after his October 2003 diagnosis. Part of it\nwas the product of the dark side of his reality distortion field. “I think Steve has such a\nstrong desire for the world to be a certain way that he wills it to be that way,” Levinson\nspeculated. “Sometimes it doesn’t work. Reality is unforgiving.” The flip side of his\nwondrous ability to focus was his fearsome willingness to filter out things he did not\nwish  to  deal  with.  This  led  to  many  of  his  great  breakthroughs,  but  it  could  also\nbackfire.  “He  has  that  ability  to  ignore  stuff  he  doesn’t  want  to  confront,”  Powell\nexplained. “It’s just the way he’s wired.” Whether it involved personal topics relating\nto his family and marriage, or professional issues relating to engineering or business\nchallenges, or health and cancer issues, Jobs sometimes simply didn’t engage.\nIn the past he had been rewarded for what his wife called his “magical thinking”—\nhis assumption that he could will things to be as he wanted. But cancer does not work\nthat way. Powell enlisted everyone close to him, including his sister Mona Simpson, to\ntry to bring him around. In July 2004 a CAT scan showed that the tumor had grown and\npossibly spread. It forced him to face reality.\nJobs underwent surgery on Saturday, July 31, 2004, at Stanford University Medical\nCenter. He did not have a full “Whipple procedure,” which removes a large part of the\nstomach and intestine as well as the pancreas. The doctors considered it, but decided\ninstead on a less radical approach, a modified Whipple that removed only part of the\npancreas.\nJobs sent employees an email the next day, using his PowerBook hooked up to an\nAirPort Express in his hospital room, announcing his surgery. He assured them that the\ntype of pancreatic cancer he had “represents about 1% of the total cases of pancreatic\ncancer diagnosed each year, and can be cured by surgical removal if diagnosed in time\n(mine was).” He said he would not require chemotherapy or radiation treatment, and he\nplanned to return to work in September. “While I’m out, I’ve asked Tim Cook to be\nresponsible for Apple’s day to day operations, so we shouldn’t miss a beat. I’m sure I’ll\nbe calling some of you way too much in August, and I look forward to seeing you in\nSeptember.”\nOne side effect of the operation would become a problem for Jobs because of his\nobsessive diets and the weird routines of purging and fasting that he had practiced since\n\nhe was a teenager. Because the pancreas provides the enzymes that allow the stomach to\ndigest food and absorb nutrients, removing part of the organ makes it hard to get enough\nprotein. Patients are advised to make sure that they eat frequent meals and maintain a\nnutritious diet, with a wide variety of meat and fish proteins as well as full-fat milk\nproducts. Jobs had never done this, and he never would.\nHe stayed in the hospital for two weeks and then struggled to regain his strength. “I\nremember coming back and sitting in that rocking chair,” he told me, pointing to one in\nhis living room. “I didn’t have the energy to walk. It took me a week before I could\nwalk around the block. I pushed myself to walk to the gardens a few blocks away, then\nfurther, and within six months I had my energy almost back.”\nUnfortunately the cancer had spread. During the operation the doctors found three\nliver metastases. Had they operated nine months earlier, they might have caught it before\nit spread, though they would never know for sure. Jobs began chemotherapy treatments,\nwhich further complicated his eating challenges.\nThe Stanford Commencement\nJobs kept his continuing battle with the cancer secret—he told everyone that he had\nbeen “cured”—just as he had kept quiet about his diagnosis in October 2003. Such\nsecrecy was not surprising; it was part of his nature. What was more surprising was his\ndecision to speak very personally and publicly about his cancer diagnosis. Although he\nrarely  gave  speeches  other  than  his  staged  product  demonstrations,  he  accepted\nStanford’s  invitation  to  give  its  June  2005  commencement  address.  He  was  in  a\nreflective mood after his health scare and turning fifty.\nFor help with the speech, he called the brilliant scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin (A  Few\nGood Men, The West Wing). Jobs sent him some thoughts. “That was in February, and I\nheard nothing, so I ping him again in April, and he says, ‘Oh, yeah,’ and I send him a\nfew more thoughts,” Jobs recounted. “I finally get him on the phone, and he keeps saying\n‘Yeah,’ but finally it’s the beginning of June, and he never sent me anything.”\nJobs got panicky. He had always written his own presentations, but he had never\ndone a commencement address. One night he sat down and wrote the speech himself,\nwith no help other than bouncing ideas off his wife. As a result, it turned out to be a\nvery intimate and simple talk, with the unadorned and personal feel of a perfect Steve\nJobs product.\nAlex Haley once said that the best way to begin a speech is “Let me tell you a story.”\nNobody is eager for a lecture, but everybody loves a story. And that was the approach\nJobs chose. “Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life,” he began. “That’s it.\nNo big deal. Just three stories.”\n\nThe first was about dropping out of Reed College. “I could stop taking the required\nclasses that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more\ninteresting.” The second was about how getting fired from Apple turned out to be good\nfor him. “The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a\nbeginner  again,  less  sure  about  everything.”  The  students  were  unusually  attentive,\ndespite a plane circling overhead with a banner that exhorted “recycle all e-waste,” and\nit was his third tale that enthralled them. It was about being diagnosed with cancer and\nthe awareness it brought:\nRemembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to\nhelp  me  make  the  big  choices  in  life.  Because  almost  everything—all  external\nexpectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away\nin the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are\ngoing to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to\nlose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\nThe artful minimalism of the speech gave it simplicity, purity, and charm. Search\nwhere  you  will,  from  anthologies  to  YouTube,  and  you  won’t  find  a  better\ncommencement  address.  Others  may  have  been  more  important,  such  as  George\nMarshall’s at Harvard in 1947 announcing a plan to rebuild Europe, but none has had\nmore grace.\nA Lion at Fifty\nFor his thirtieth and fortieth birthdays, Jobs had celebrated with the stars of Silicon\nValley and other assorted celebrities. But when he turned fifty in 2005, after coming\nback from his cancer surgery, the surprise party that his wife arranged featured mainly\nhis closest friends and professional colleagues. It was at the comfortable San Francisco\nhome of some friends, and the great chef Alice Waters prepared salmon from Scotland\nalong  with  couscous  and  a  variety  of  garden-raised  vegetables.  “It  was  beautifully\nwarm and intimate, with everyone and the kids all able to sit in one room,” Waters\nrecalled. The entertainment was comedy improvisation done by the cast of Whose Line\nIs  It  Anyway? Jobs’s close friend Mike Slade was there, along with colleagues from\nApple and Pixar, including Lasseter, Cook, Schiller, Clow, Rubinstein, and Tevanian.\nCook had done a good job running the company during Jobs’s absence. He kept\nApple’s  temperamental  actors  performing  well,  and  he  avoided  stepping  into  the\nlimelight.  Jobs  liked  strong  personalities,  up  to  a  point,  but  he  had  never  truly\n\nempowered a deputy or shared the stage. It was hard to be his understudy. You were\ndamned if you shone, and damned if you didn’t. Cook had managed to navigate those\nshoals. He was calm and decisive when in command, but he didn’t seek any notice or\nacclaim for himself. “Some people resent the fact that Steve gets credit for everything,\nbut I’ve never given a rat’s ass about that,” said Cook. “Frankly speaking, I’d prefer my\nname never be in the paper.”\nWhen Jobs returned from his medical leave, Cook resumed his role as the person\nwho kept the moving parts at Apple tightly meshed and remained unfazed by Jobs’s\ntantrums. “What I learned about Steve was that people mistook some of his comments as\nranting or negativism, but it was really just the way he showed passion. So that’s how I\nprocessed it, and I never took issues personally.” In many ways he was Jobs’s mirror\nimage: unflappable, steady in his moods, and (as the thesaurus in the NeXT would have\nnoted) saturnine rather than mercurial. “I’m a good negotiator, but he’s probably better\nthan me because he’s a cool customer,” Jobs later said. After adding a bit more praise,\nhe quietly added a reservation, one that was serious but rarely spoken: “But Tim’s not a\nproduct person, per se.”\nIn the fall of 2005, after returning from his medical leave, Jobs tapped Cook to\nbecome Apple’s chief operating officer. They were flying together to Japan. Jobs didn’t\nreally ask Cook; he simply turned to him and said, “I’ve decided to make you COO.”\nAround that time, Jobs’s old friends Jon Rubinstein and Avie Tevanian, the hardware\nand software lieutenants who had been recruited during the 1997 restoration, decided to\nleave. In Tevanian’s case, he had made a lot of money and was ready to quit working.\n“Avie is a brilliant guy and a nice guy, much more grounded than Ruby and doesn’t\ncarry the big ego,” said Jobs. “It was a huge loss for us when Avie left. He’s a one-of-a-\nkind person—a genius.”\nRubinstein’s case was a little more contentious. He was upset by Cook’s ascendency\nand frazzled after working for nine years under Jobs. Their shouting matches became\nmore frequent. There was also a substantive issue: Rubinstein was repeatedly clashing\nwith Jony Ive, who used to work for him and now reported directly to Jobs. Ive was\nalways pushing the envelope with designs that dazzled but were difficult to engineer. It\nwas Rubinstein’s job to get the hardware built in a practical way, so he often balked. He\nwas by nature cautious. “In the end, Ruby’s from HP,” said Jobs. “And he never delved\ndeep, he wasn’t aggressive.”\nThere was, for example, the case of the screws that held the handles on the Power\nMac G4. Ive decided that they should have a certain polish and shape. But Rubinstein\nthought that would be “astronomically” costly and delay the project for weeks, so he\nvetoed the idea. His job was to deliver products, which meant making trade-offs. Ive\nviewed that approach as inimical to innovation, so he would go both above him to Jobs\nand also around him to the midlevel engineers. “Ruby would say, ‘You can’t do this, it\nwill delay,’ and I would say, ‘I think we can,’” Ive recalled. “And I would know,\n\nbecause I had worked behind his back with the product teams.” In this and other cases,\nJobs came down on Ive’s side.\nAt times Ive and Rubinstein got into arguments that almost led to blows. Finally Ive\ntold Jobs, “It’s him or me.” Jobs chose Ive. By that point Rubinstein was ready to leave.\nHe and his wife had bought property in Mexico, and he wanted time off to build a home\nthere. He eventually went to work for Palm, which was trying to match Apple’s iPhone.\nJobs  was  so  furious  that  Palm  was  hiring  some  of  his  former  employees  that  he\ncomplained to Bono, who was a cofounder of a private equity group, led by the former\nApple CFO Fred Anderson, that had bought a controlling stake in Palm. Bono sent Jobs\na note back saying, “You should chill out about this. This is like the Beatles ringing up\nbecause  Herman  and  the  Hermits  have  taken  one  of  their  road  crew.”  Jobs  later\nadmitted  that  he  had  overreacted.  “The  fact  that  they  completely  failed  salves  that\nwound,” he said.\nJobs was able to build a new management team that was less contentious and a bit\nmore subdued. Its main players, in addition to Cook and Ive, were Scott Forstall running\niPhone  software,  Phil  Schiller  in  charge  of  marketing,  Bob  Mansfield  doing  Mac\nhardware, Eddy Cue handling Internet services, and Peter Oppenheimer as the chief\nfinancial officer. Even though there was a surface sameness to his top team—all were\nmiddle-aged  white  males—there  was  a  range  of  styles.  Ive  was  emotional  and\nexpressive;  Cook  was  as  cool  as  steel.  They  all  knew  they  were  expected  to  be\ndeferential to Jobs while also pushing back on his ideas and being willing to argue—a\ntricky balance to maintain, but each did it well. “I realized very early that if you didn’t\nvoice your opinion, he would mow you down,” said Cook. “He takes contrary positions\nto create more discussion, because it may lead to a better result. So if you don’t feel\ncomfortable disagreeing, then you’ll never survive.”\nThe key venue for freewheeling discourse was the Monday morning executive team\ngathering, which started at 9 and went for three or four hours. The focus was always on\nthe future: What should each product do next? What new things should be developed?\nJobs used the meeting to enforce a sense of shared mission at Apple. This served to\ncentralize control, which made the company seem as tightly integrated as a good Apple\nproduct,  and  prevented  the  struggles  between  divisions  that  plagued  decentralized\ncompanies.\nJobs also used the meetings to enforce focus. At Robert Friedland’s farm, his job\nhad been to prune the apple trees so that they would stay strong, and that became a\nmetaphor for his pruning at Apple. Instead of encouraging each group to let product\nlines proliferate based on marketing considerations, or permitting a thousand ideas to\nbloom, Jobs insisted that Apple focus on just two or three priorities at a time. “There is\nno one better at turning off the noise that is going on around him,” Cook said. “That\nallows him to focus on a few things and say no to many things. Few people are really\ngood at that.”\n\nIn order to institutionalize the lessons that he and his team were learning, Jobs\nstarted an in-house center called Apple University. He hired Joel Podolny, who was\ndean of the Yale School of Management, to compile a series of case studies analyzing\nimportant  decisions  the  company  had  made,  including  the  switch  to  the  Intel\nmicroprocessor and the decision to open the Apple Stores. Top executives spent time\nteaching the cases to new employees, so that the Apple style of decision making would\nbe embedded in the culture.\nIn ancient Rome, when a victorious general paraded through the streets, legend has it\nthat he was sometimes trailed by a servant whose job it was to repeat to him, “Memento\nmori”: Remember you will die. A reminder of mortality would help the hero keep things\nin perspective, instill some humility. Jobs’s memento mori had been delivered by his\ndoctors, but it did not instill humility. Instead he roared back after his recovery with\neven more passion. The illness reminded him that he had nothing to lose, so he should\nforge ahead full speed. “He came back on a mission,” said Cook. “Even though he was\nnow running a large company, he kept making bold moves that I don’t think anybody else\nwould have done.”\nFor a while there was some evidence, or at least hope, that he had tempered his\npersonal style, that facing cancer and turning fifty had caused him to be a bit less brutish\nwhen he was upset. “Right after he came back from his operation, he didn’t do the\nhumiliation bit as much,” Tevanian recalled. “If he was displeased, he might scream and\nget hopping mad and use expletives, but he wouldn’t do it in a way that would totally\ndestroy the person he was talking to. It was just his way to get the person to do a better\njob.” Tevanian reflected for a moment as he said this, then added a caveat: “Unless he\nthought someone was really bad and had to go, which happened every once in a while.”\nEventually, however, the rough edges returned. Because most of his colleagues were\nused to it by then and had learned to cope, what upset them most was when his ire\nturned on strangers. “Once we went to a Whole Foods market to get a smoothie,” Ive\nrecalled. “And this older woman was making it, and he really got on her about how she\nwas doing it. Then later, he sympathized. ‘She’s an older woman and doesn’t want to be\ndoing this job.’ He didn’t connect the two. He was being a purist in both cases.”\nOn a trip to London with Jobs, Ive had the thankless task of choosing the hotel. He\npicked the Hempel, a tranquil five-star boutique hotel with a sophisticated minimalism\nthat he thought Jobs would love. But as soon as they checked in, he braced himself, and\nsure enough his phone rang a minute later. “I hate my room,” Jobs declared. “It’s a piece\nof shit, let’s go.” So Ive gathered his luggage and went to the front desk, where Jobs\nbluntly told the shocked clerk what he thought. Ive realized that most people, himself\namong them, tend not to be direct when they feel something is shoddy because they want\nto be liked, “which is actually a vain trait.” That was an overly kind explanation. In any\ncase, it was not a trait Jobs had.\n\nBecause Ive was so instinctively nice, he puzzled over why Jobs, whom he deeply\nliked, behaved as he did. One evening, in a San Francisco bar, he leaned forward with\nan earnest intensity and tried to analyze it:\nHe’s  a  very,  very  sensitive  guy.  That’s  one  of  the  things  that  makes  his  antisocial\nbehavior, his rudeness, so unconscionable. I can understand why people who are thick-\nskinned and unfeeling can be rude, but not sensitive people. I once asked him why he\ngets so mad about stuff. He said, “But I don’t stay mad.” He has this very childish\nability to get really worked up about something, and it doesn’t stay with him at all. But\nthere are other times, I think honestly, when he’s very frustrated, and his way to achieve\ncatharsis is to hurt somebody. And I think he feels he has a liberty and a license to do\nthat. The normal rules of social engagement, he feels, don’t apply to him. Because of\nhow  very  sensitive  he  is,  he  knows  exactly  how  to  efficiently  and  effectively  hurt\nsomeone. And he does do that.\nEvery now and then a wise colleague would pull Jobs aside to try to get him to settle\ndown. Lee Clow was a master. “Steve, can I talk to you?” he would quietly say when\nJobs had belittled someone publicly. He would go into Jobs’s office and explain how\nhard everyone was working. “When you humiliate them, it’s more debilitating than\nstimulating,” he said in one such session. Jobs would apologize and say he understood.\nBut then he would lapse again. “It’s simply who I am,” he would say.\nOne thing that did mellow was his attitude toward Bill Gates. Microsoft had kept its end\nof the bargain it made in 1997, when it agreed to continue developing great software for\nthe Macintosh. Also, it was becoming less relevant as a competitor, having failed thus\nfar  to  replicate  Apple’s  digital  hub  strategy.  Gates  and  Jobs  had  very  different\napproaches  to  products  and  innovation,  but  their  rivalry  had  produced  in  each  a\nsurprising self-awareness.\nFor  their  All  Things  Digital  conference  in  May  2007,  the Wall  Street  Journal\ncolumnists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher worked to get them together for a joint\ninterview. Mossberg first invited Jobs, who didn’t go to many such conferences, and\nwas surprised when he said he would do it if Gates would. On hearing that, Gates\naccepted as well.\nMossberg wanted the evening joint appearance to be a cordial discussion, not a\ndebate, but that seemed less likely when Jobs unleashed a swipe at Microsoft during a\nsolo interview earlier that day. Asked about the fact that Apple’s iTunes software for\nWindows computers was extremely popular, Jobs joked, “It’s like giving a glass of ice\nwater to somebody in hell.”\n\nSo when it was time for Gates and Jobs to meet in the green room before their joint\nsession that evening, Mossberg was worried. Gates got there first, with his aide Larry\nCohen, who had briefed him about Jobs’s remark earlier that day. When Jobs ambled in\na few minutes later, he grabbed a bottle of water from the ice bucket and sat down.\nAfter a moment or two of silence, Gates said, “So I guess I’m the representative from\nhell.” He wasn’t smiling. Jobs paused, gave him one of his impish grins, and handed\nhim the ice water. Gates relaxed, and the tension dissipated.\nThe result was a fascinating duet, in which each wunderkind of the digital age spoke\nwarily, and then warmly, about the other. Most memorably they gave candid answers\nwhen the technology strategist Lise Buyer, who was in the audience, asked what each\nhad learned from observing the other. “Well, I’d give a lot to have Steve’s taste,” Gates\nanswered.  There  was  a  bit  of  nervous  laughter;  Jobs  had  famously  said,  ten  years\nearlier, that his problem with Microsoft was that it had absolutely no taste. But Gates\ninsisted he was serious. Jobs was a “natural in terms of intuitive taste.” He recalled\nhow he and Jobs used to sit together reviewing the software that Microsoft was making\nfor the Macintosh. “I’d see Steve make the decision based on a sense of people and\nproduct that, you know, is hard for me to explain. The way he does things is just\ndifferent and I think it’s magical. And in that case, wow.”\nJobs stared at the floor. Later he told me that he was blown away by how honest and\ngracious Gates had just been. Jobs was equally honest, though not quite as gracious,\nwhen his turn came. He described the great divide between the Apple theology of\nbuilding  end-to-end  integrated  products  and  Microsoft’s  openness  to  licensing  its\nsoftware to competing hardware makers. In the music market, the integrated approach,\nas manifested in his iTunes-iPod package, was proving to be the better, he noted, but\nMicrosoft’s decoupled approach was faring better in the personal computer market. One\nquestion  he  raised  in  an  offhand  way  was:  Which  approach  might  work  better  for\nmobile phones?\nThen he went on to make an insightful point: This difference in design philosophy, he\nsaid,  led  him  and  Apple  to  be  less  good  at  collaborating  with  other  companies.\n“Because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren’t\nso good at partnering with people,” he said. “And I think if Apple could have had a\nlittle more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well.”\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\nTHE iPHONE\nThree Revolutionary Products in One\nAn iPod That Makes Calls\nBy 2005 iPod sales were skyrocketing. An astonishing twenty million were sold that\nyear,  quadruple  the  number  of  the  year  before.  The  product  was  becoming  more\nimportant to the company’s bottom line, accounting for 45% of the revenue that year, and\nit was also burnishing the hipness of the company’s image in a way that drove sales of\nMacs.\nThat is why Jobs was worried. “He was always obsessing about what could mess us\nup,” board member Art Levinson recalled. The conclusion he had come to: “The device\nthat can eat our lunch is the cell phone.” As he explained to the board, the digital\ncamera market was being decimated now that phones were equipped with cameras. The\nsame could happen to the iPod, if phone manufacturers started to build music players\ninto them. “Everyone carries a phone, so that could render the iPod unnecessary.”\nHis first strategy was to do something that he had admitted in front of Bill Gates was\nnot in his DNA: to partner with another company. He began talking to Ed Zander, the\nnew CEO of Motorola, about making a companion to Motorola’s popular RAZR, which\nwas a cell phone and digital camera, that would have an iPod built in. Thus was born\nthe  ROKR.  It  ended  up  having  neither  the  enticing  minimalism  of  an  iPod  nor  the\nconvenient slimness of a RAZR. Ugly, difficult to load, and with an arbitrary hundred-\nsong limit, it had all the hallmarks of a product that had been negotiated by a committee,\nwhich was counter to the way Jobs liked to work. Instead of hardware, software, and\ncontent all being controlled by one company, they were cobbled together by Motorola,\nApple, and the wireless carrier Cingular. “You call this the phone of the future?” Wired\nscoffed on its November 2005 cover.\n\nJobs was furious. “I’m sick of dealing with these stupid companies like Motorola,”\nhe told Tony Fadell and others at one of the iPod product review meetings. “Let’s do it\nourselves.” He had noticed something odd about the cell phones on the market: They all\nstank, just like portable music players used to. “We would sit around talking about how\nmuch we hated our phones,” he recalled. “They were way too complicated. They had\nfeatures nobody could figure out, including the address book. It was just Byzantine.”\nGeorge Riley, an outside lawyer for Apple, remembers sitting at meetings to go over\nlegal issues, and Jobs would get bored, grab Riley’s mobile phone, and start pointing\nout all the ways it was “brain-dead.” So Jobs and his team became excited about the\nprospect of building a phone that they would want to use. “That’s the best motivator of\nall,” Jobs later said.\nAnother motivator was the potential market. More than 825 million mobile phones\nwere sold in 2005, to everyone from grammar schoolers to grandmothers. Since most\nwere junky, there was room for a premium and hip product, just as there had been in the\nportable music-player market. At first he gave the project to the Apple group that was\nmaking the AirPort wireless base station, on the theory that it was a wireless product.\nBut he soon realized that it was basically a consumer device, like the iPod, so he\nreassigned it to Fadell and his teammates.\nTheir initial approach was to modify the iPod. They tried to use the trackwheel as a\nway for a user to scroll through phone options and, without a keyboard, try to enter\nnumbers. It was not a natural fit. “We were having a lot of problems using the wheel,\nespecially in getting it to dial phone numbers,” Fadell recalled. “It was cumbersome.” It\nwas fine for scrolling through an address book, but horrible at inputting anything. The\nteam kept trying to convince themselves that users would mainly be calling people who\nwere already in their address book, but they knew that it wouldn’t really work.\nAt that time there was a second project under way at Apple: a secret effort to build a\ntablet computer. In 2005 these narratives intersected, and the ideas for the tablet flowed\ninto the planning for the phone. In other words, the idea for the iPad actually came\nbefore, and helped to shape, the birth of the iPhone.\nMulti-touch\nOne of the engineers developing a tablet PC at Microsoft was married to a friend of\nLaurene and Steve Jobs, and for his fiftieth birthday he wanted to have a dinner party\nthat included them along with Bill and Melinda Gates. Jobs went, a bit reluctantly.\n“Steve was actually quite friendly to me at the dinner,” Gates recalled, but he “wasn’t\nparticularly friendly” to the birthday guy.\nGates was annoyed that the guy kept revealing information about the tablet PC he had\ndeveloped  for  Microsoft.  “He’s  our  employee  and  he’s  revealing  our  intellectual\n\nproperty,” Gates recounted. Jobs was also annoyed, and it had just the consequence that\nGates feared. As Jobs recalled:\nThis guy badgered me about how Microsoft was going to completely change the world\nwith this tablet PC software and eliminate all notebook computers, and Apple ought to\nlicense his Microsoft software. But he was doing the device all wrong. It had a stylus.\nAs soon as you have a stylus, you’re dead. This dinner was like the tenth time he talked\nto me about it, and I was so sick of it that I came home and said, “Fuck this, let’s show\nhim what a tablet can really be.”\nJobs went into the office the next day, gathered his team, and said, “I want to make a\ntablet, and it can’t have a keyboard or a stylus.” Users would be able to type by\ntouching the screen with their fingers. That meant the screen needed to have a feature\nthat became known as multi-touch, the ability to process multiple inputs at the same\ntime. “So could you guys come up with a multi-touch, touch-sensitive display for me?”\nhe asked. It took them about six months, but they came up with a crude but workable\nprototype.\nJony Ive had a different memory of how multi-touch was developed. He said his\ndesign team had already been working on a multi-touch input that was developed for the\ntrackpads of Apple’s MacBook Pro, and they were experimenting with ways to transfer\nthat capability to a computer screen. They used a projector to show on a wall what it\nwould look like. “This is going to change everything,” Ive told his team. But he was\ncareful not to show it to Jobs right away, especially since his people were working on it\nin their spare time and he didn’t want to quash their enthusiasm. “Because Steve is so\nquick to give an opinion, I don’t show him stuff in front of other people,” Ive recalled.\n“He might say, ‘This is shit,’ and snuff the idea. I feel that ideas are very fragile, so you\nhave to be tender when they are in development. I realized that if he pissed on this, it\nwould be so sad, because I knew it was so important.”\nIve set up the demonstration in his conference room and showed it to Jobs privately,\nknowing that he was less likely to make a snap judgment if there was no audience.\nFortunately he loved it. “This is the future,” he exulted.\nIt was in fact such a good idea that Jobs realized that it could solve the problem they\nwere having creating an interface for the proposed cell phone. That project was far\nmore important, so he put the tablet development on hold while the multi-touch interface\nwas adopted for a phone-size screen. “If it worked on a phone,” he recalled, “I knew\nwe could go back and use it on a tablet.”\nJobs called Fadell, Rubinstein, and Schiller to a secret meeting in the design studio\nconference room, where Ive gave a demonstration of multi-touch. “Wow!” said Fadell.\nEveryone liked it, but they were not sure that they would be able to make it work on a\n\nmobile phone. They decided to proceed on two paths: P1 was the code name for the\nphone being developed using an iPod trackwheel, and P2 was the new alternative using\na multi-touch screen.\nA small company in Delaware called FingerWorks was already making a line of\nmulti-touch trackpads. Founded by two academics at the University of Delaware, John\nElias and Wayne Westerman, FingerWorks had developed some tablets with multi-touch\nsensing capabilities and taken out patents on ways to translate various finger gestures,\nsuch as pinches and swipes, into useful functions. In early 2005 Apple quietly acquired\nthe company, all of its patents, and the services of its two founders. FingerWorks quit\nselling its products to others, and it began filing its new patents in Apple’s name.\nAfter six months of work on the trackwheel P1 and the multi-touch P2 phone options,\nJobs called his inner circle into his conference room to make a decision. Fadell had\nbeen trying hard to develop the trackwheel model, but he admitted they had not cracked\nthe problem of figuring out a simple way to dial calls. The multi-touch approach was\nriskier, because they were unsure whether they could execute the engineering, but it was\nalso more exciting and promising. “We all know this is the one we want to do,” said\nJobs, pointing to the touchscreen. “So let’s make it work.” It was what he liked to call a\nbet-the-company moment, high risk and high reward if it succeeded.\nA couple of members of the team argued for having a keyboard as well, given the\npopularity of the BlackBerry, but Jobs vetoed the idea. A physical keyboard would take\naway  space  from  the  screen,  and  it  would  not  be  as  flexible  and  adaptable  as  a\ntouchscreen  keyboard.  “A  hardware  keyboard  seems  like  an  easy  solution,  but  it’s\nconstraining,” he said. “Think of all the innovations we’d be able to adapt if we did the\nkeyboard onscreen with software. Let’s bet on it, and then we’ll find a way to make it\nwork.” The result was a device that displays a numerical pad when you want to dial a\nphone number, a typewriter keyboard when you want to write, and whatever buttons you\nmight  need  for  each  particular  activity.  And  then  they  all  disappear  when  you’re\nwatching a video. By having software replace hardware, the interface became fluid and\nflexible.\nJobs spent part of every day for six months helping to refine the display. “It was the\nmost complex fun I’ve ever had,” he recalled. “It was like being the one evolving the\nvariations on ‘Sgt. Pepper.’” A lot of features that seem simple now were the result of\ncreative brainstorms. For example, the team worried about how to prevent the device\nfrom playing music or making a call accidentally when it was jangling in your pocket.\nJobs was congenitally averse to having on-off switches, which he deemed “inelegant.”\nThe solution was “Swipe to Open,” the simple and fun on-screen slider that activated\nthe device when it had gone dormant. Another breakthrough was the sensor that figured\nout when you put the phone to your ear, so that your lobes didn’t accidentally activate\nsome function. And of course the icons came in his favorite shape, the primitive he\nmade Bill Atkinson design into the software of the first Macintosh: rounded rectangles.\nIn session after session, with Jobs immersed in every detail, the team members figured\n\nout ways to simplify what other phones made complicated. They added a big bar to\nguide you in putting calls on hold or making conference calls, found easy ways to\nnavigate through email, and created icons you could scroll through horizontally to get to\ndifferent apps—all of which were easier because they could be used visually on the\nscreen rather than by using a keyboard built into the hardware.\nGorilla Glass\nJobs became infatuated with different materials the way he did with certain foods.\nWhen he went back to Apple in 1997 and started work on the iMac, he had embraced\nwhat could be done with translucent and colored plastic. The next phase was metal. He\nand Ive replaced the curvy plastic PowerBook G3 with the sleek titanium PowerBook\nG4, which they redesigned two years later in aluminum, as if just to demonstrate how\nmuch they liked different metals. Then they did an iMac and an iPod Nano in anodized\naluminum, which meant that the metal had been put in an acid bath and electrified so that\nits surface oxidized. Jobs was told it could not be done in the quantities they needed, so\nhe had a factory built in China to handle it. Ive went there, during the SARS epidemic,\nto  oversee  the  process.  “I  stayed  for  three  months  in  a  dormitory  to  work  on  the\nprocess,” he recalled. “Ruby and others said it would be impossible, but I wanted to do\nit because Steve and I felt that the anodized aluminum had a real integrity to it.”\nNext was glass. “After we did metal, I looked at Jony and said that we had to master\nglass,” said Jobs. For the Apple stores, they had created huge windowpanes and glass\nstairs. For the iPhone, the original plan was for it to have a plastic screen, like the iPod.\nBut Jobs decided it would feel much more elegant and substantive if the screens were\nglass. So he set about finding a glass that would be strong and resistant to scratches.\nThe natural place to look was Asia, where the glass for the stores was being made.\nBut Jobs’s friend John Seeley Brown, who was on the board of Corning Glass in\nUpstate New York, told him that he should talk to that company’s young and dynamic\nCEO, Wendell Weeks. So he dialed the main Corning switchboard number and asked to\nbe put through to Weeks. He got an assistant, who offered to pass along the message.\n“No, I’m Steve Jobs,” he replied. “Put me through.” The assistant refused. Jobs called\nBrown and complained that he had been subjected to “typical East Coast bullshit.”\nWhen Weeks heard that, he called the main Apple switchboard and asked to speak to\nJobs. He was told to put his request in writing and send it in by fax. When Jobs was told\nwhat happened, he took a liking to Weeks and invited him to Cupertino.\nJobs described the type of glass Apple wanted for the iPhone, and Weeks told him\nthat Corning had developed a chemical exchange process in the 1960s that led to what\nthey dubbed “gorilla glass.” It was incredibly strong, but it had never found a market, so\nCorning  quit  making  it.  Jobs  said  he  doubted  it  was  good  enough,  and  he  started\n\nexplaining to Weeks how glass was made. This amused Weeks, who of course knew\nmore than Jobs about that topic. “Can you shut up,” Weeks interjected, “and let me teach\nyou some science?” Jobs was taken aback and fell silent. Weeks went to the whiteboard\nand  gave  a  tutorial  on  the  chemistry,  which  involved  an  ion-exchange  process  that\nproduced a compression layer on the surface of the glass. This turned Jobs around, and\nhe said he wanted as much gorilla glass as Corning could make within six months. “We\ndon’t have the capacity,” Weeks replied. “None of our plants make the glass now.”\n“Don’t be afraid,” Jobs replied. This stunned Weeks, who was good-humored and\nconfident but not used to Jobs’s reality distortion field. He tried to explain that a false\nsense of confidence would not overcome engineering challenges, but that was a premise\nthat Jobs had repeatedly shown he didn’t accept. He stared at Weeks unblinking. “Yes,\nyou can do it,” he said. “Get your mind around it. You can do it.”\nAs Weeks retold this story, he shook his head in astonishment. “We did it in under six\nmonths,” he said. “We produced a glass that had never been made.” Corning’s facility in\nHarrodsburg, Kentucky, which had been making LCD displays, was converted almost\novernight to make gorilla glass full-time. “We put our best scientists and engineers on it,\nand we just made it work.” In his airy office, Weeks has just one framed memento on\ndisplay. It’s a message Jobs sent the day the iPhone came out: “We couldn’t have done it\nwithout you.”\nThe Design\nOn many of his major projects, such as the first Toy Story and the Apple store, Jobs\npressed “pause” as they neared completion and decided to make major revisions. That\nhappened with the design of the iPhone as well. The initial design had the glass screen\nset into an aluminum case. One Monday morning Jobs went over to see Ive. “I didn’t\nsleep last night,” he said, “because I realized that I just don’t love it.” It was the most\nimportant product he had made since the first Macintosh, and it just didn’t look right to\nhim. Ive, to his dismay, instantly realized that Jobs was right. “I remember feeling\nabsolutely embarrassed that he had to make the observation.”\nThe problem was that the iPhone should have been all about the display, but in their\ncurrent design the case competed with the display instead of getting out of the way. The\nwhole device felt too masculine, task-driven, efficient. “Guys, you’ve killed yourselves\nover this design for the last nine months, but we’re going to change it,” Jobs told Ive’s\nteam. “We’re all going to have to work nights and weekends, and if you want we can\nhand out some guns so you can kill us now.” Instead of balking, the team agreed. “It was\none of my proudest moments at Apple,” Jobs recalled.\nThe new design ended up with just a thin stainless steel bezel that allowed the\ngorilla glass display to go right to the edge. Every part of the device seemed to defer to\n\nthe screen. The new look was austere, yet also friendly. You could fondle it. It meant\nthey had to redo the circuit boards, antenna, and processor placement inside, but Jobs\nordered the change. “Other companies may have shipped,” said Fadell, “but we pressed\nthe reset button and started over.”\nOne aspect of the design, which reflected not only Jobs’s perfectionism but also his\ndesire to control, was that the device was tightly sealed. The case could not be opened,\neven to change the battery. As with the original Macintosh in 1984, Jobs did not want\npeople fiddling inside. In fact when Apple discovered in 2011 that third-party repair\nshops were opening up the iPhone 4, it replaced the tiny screws with a tamper-resistant\nPentalobe  screw  that  was  impossible  to  open  with  a  commercially  available\nscrewdriver. By not having a replaceable battery, it was possible to make the iPhone\nmuch thinner. For Jobs, thinner was always better. “He’s always believed that thin is\nbeautiful,” said Tim Cook. “You can see that in all of the work. We have the thinnest\nnotebook, the thinnest smartphone, and we made the iPad thin and then even thinner.”\nThe Launch\nWhen it came time to launch the iPhone, Jobs decided, as usual, to grant a magazine a\nspecial sneak preview. He called John Huey, the editor in chief of Time Inc., and began\nwith his typical superlative: “This is the best thing we’ve ever done.” He wanted to\ngive Time the exclusive, “but there’s nobody smart enough at Time to write it, so I’m\ngoing to give it to someone else.” Huey introduced him to Lev Grossman, a savvy\ntechnology writer (and novelist) at Time. In his piece Grossman correctly noted that the\niPhone did not really invent many new features, it just made these features a lot more\nusable. “But that’s important. When our tools don’t work, we tend to blame ourselves,\nfor being too stupid or not reading the manual or having too-fat fingers. ... When our\ntools are broken, we feel broken. And when somebody fixes one, we feel a tiny bit more\nwhole.”\nFor the unveiling at the January 2007 Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs invited back\nAndy Hertzfeld, Bill Atkinson, Steve Wozniak, and the 1984 Macintosh team, as he had\ndone when he launched the iMac. In a career of dazzling product presentations, this may\nhave been his best. “Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that\nchanges  everything,”  he  began.  He  referred  to  two  earlier  examples:  the  original\nMacintosh, which “changed the whole computer industry,” and the first iPod, which\n“changed the entire music industry.” Then he carefully built up to the product he was\nabout to launch: “Today, we’re introducing three revolutionary products of this class.\nThe first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary\nmobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.” He\n\nrepeated the list for emphasis, then asked, “Are you getting it? These are not three\nseparate devices, this is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.”\nWhen the iPhone went on sale five months later, at the end of June 2007, Jobs and\nhis wife walked to the Apple store in Palo Alto to take in the excitement. Since he often\ndid that on the day new products went on sale, there were some fans hanging out in\nanticipation, and they greeted him as they would have Moses if he had walked in to buy\nthe Bible. Among the faithful were Hertzfeld and Atkinson. “Bill stayed in line all\nnight,” Hertzfeld said. Jobs waved his arms and started laughing. “I sent him one,” he\nsaid. Hertzfeld replied, “He needs six.”\nThe iPhone was immediately dubbed “the Jesus Phone” by bloggers. But Apple’s\ncompetitors emphasized that, at $500, it cost too much to be successful. “It’s the most\nexpensive phone in the world,” Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer said in a CNBC interview.\n“And it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard.”\nOnce again Microsoft had underestimated Jobs’s product. By the end of 2010, Apple\nhad  sold  ninety  million  iPhones,  and  it  reaped  more  than  half  of  the  total  profits\ngenerated in the global cell phone market.\n“Steve  understands  desire,”  said  Alan  Kay,  the  Xerox  PARC  pioneer  who  had\nenvisioned a “Dynabook” tablet computer forty years earlier. Kay was good at making\nprophetic assessments, so Jobs asked him what he thought of the iPhone. “Make the\nscreen five inches by eight inches, and you’ll rule the world,” Kay said. He did not\nknow that the design of the iPhone had started with, and would someday lead to, ideas\nfor a tablet computer that would fulfill—indeed exceed—his vision for the Dynabook.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\nROUND TWO\nThe Cancer Recurs\nThe Battles of 2008\nBy the beginning of 2008 it was clear to Jobs and his doctors that his cancer was\nspreading. When they had taken out his pancreatic tumors in 2004, he had the cancer\ngenome partially sequenced. That helped his doctors determine which pathways were\nbroken, and they were treating him with targeted therapies that they thought were most\nlikely to work.\nHe was also being treated for pain, usually with morphine-based analgesics. One\nday in February 2008 when Powell’s close friend Kathryn Smith was staying with them\nin Palo Alto, she and Jobs took a walk. “He told me that when he feels really bad, he\njust concentrates on the pain, goes into the pain, and that seems to dissipate it,” she\nrecalled. That wasn’t exactly true, however. When Jobs was in pain, he let everyone\naround him know it.\nThere was  another  health  issue  that  became  increasingly  problematic,  one  that\nmedical researchers didn’t focus on as rigorously as they did cancer or pain. He was\nhaving eating problems and losing weight. Partly this was because he had lost much of\nhis pancreas, which produces the enzymes needed to digest protein and other nutrients.\nIt was also because both the cancer and the morphine reduced his appetite. And then\nthere was the psychological component, which the doctors barely knew how to address:\nSince his early teens, he had indulged his weird obsession with extremely restrictive\ndiets and fasts.\nEven after he married and had children, he retained his dubious eating habits. He\nwould spend weeks eating the same thing—carrot salad with lemon, or just apples—\nand then suddenly spurn that food and declare that he had stopped eating it. He would go\n\non fasts, just as he did as a teenager, and he became sanctimonious as he lectured others\nat the table on the virtues of whatever eating regimen he was following. Powell had\nbeen a vegan when they were first married, but after her husband’s operation she began\nto diversify their family meals with fish and other proteins. Their son, Reed, who had\nbeen a vegetarian, became a “hearty omnivore.” They knew it was important for his\nfather to get diverse sources of protein.\nThe family hired a gentle and versatile cook, Bryar Brown, who once worked for\nAlice Waters at Chez Panisse. He came each afternoon and made a panoply of healthy\nofferings for dinner, which used the herbs and vegetables that Powell grew in their\ngarden. When Jobs expressed any whim—carrot salad, pasta with basil, lemongrass\nsoup—Brown would quietly and patiently find a way to make it. Jobs had always been\nan extremely opinionated eater, with a tendency to instantly judge any food as either\nfantastic  or  terrible.  He  could  taste  two  avocados  that  most  mortals  would  find\nindistinguishable, and declare that one was the best avocado ever grown and the other\ninedible.\nBeginning in early 2008 Jobs’s eating disorders got worse. On some nights he would\nstare at the floor and ignore all of the dishes set out on the long kitchen table. When\nothers were halfway through their meal, he would abruptly get up and leave, saying\nnothing. It was stressful for his family. They watched him lose forty pounds during the\nspring of 2008.\nHis health problems became public again in March 2008, when Fortune published a\npiece called “The Trouble with Steve Jobs.” It revealed that he had tried to treat his\ncancer  with  diets  for  nine  months  and  also  investigated  his  involvement  in  the\nbackdating of Apple stock options. As the story was being prepared, Jobs invited—\nsummoned—Fortune’s managing editor Andy Serwer to Cupertino to pressure him to\nspike it. He leaned into Serwer’s face and asked, “So, you’ve uncovered the fact that\nI’m an asshole. Why is that news?” Jobs made the same rather self-aware argument\nwhen he called Serwer’s boss at Time Inc., John Huey, from a satellite phone he brought\nto Hawaii’s Kona Village. He offered to convene a panel of fellow CEOs and be part of\na discussion about what health issues are proper to disclose, but only if Fortune killed\nits piece. The magazine didn’t.\nWhen Jobs  introduced  the  iPhone  3G  in  June  2008,  he  was  so  thin  that  it\novershadowed  the  product  announcement.  In Esquire  Tom  Junod  described  the\n“withered” figure onstage as being “gaunt as a pirate, dressed in what had heretofore\nbeen  the  vestments  of  his  invulnerability.”  Apple  released  a  statement  saying,\nuntruthfully, that his weight loss was the result of “a common bug.” The following\nmonth, as questions persisted, the company released another statement saying that Jobs’s\nhealth was “a private matter.”\nJoe Nocera of the New York Times wrote a column denouncing the handling of Jobs’s\nhealth issues. “Apple simply can’t be trusted to tell the truth about its chief executive,”\nhe wrote in late July. “Under Mr. Jobs, Apple has created a culture of secrecy that has\n\nserved it well in many ways—the speculation over which products Apple will unveil at\nthe annual Macworld conference has been one of the company’s best marketing tools.\nBut that same culture poisons its corporate governance.” As he was writing the column\nand  getting  the  standard  “a  private  matter”  comment  from  all  at  Apple,  he  got  an\nunexpected call from Jobs himself. “This is Steve Jobs,” he began. “You think I’m an\narrogant asshole who thinks he’s above the law, and I think you’re a slime bucket who\ngets most of his facts wrong.” After that rather arresting opening, Jobs offered up some\ninformation about his health, but only if Nocera would keep it off the record. Nocera\nhonored  the  request,  but  he  was  able  to  report  that,  while  Jobs’s  health  problems\namounted to more than a common bug, “they weren’t life-threatening and he doesn’t\nhave a recurrence of cancer.” Jobs had given Nocera more information than he was\nwilling to give his own board and shareholders, but it was not the full truth.\nPartly due to concern about Jobs’s weight loss, Apple’s stock price drifted from\n$188 at the beginning of June 2008 down to $156 at the end of July. Matters were not\nhelped  in  late  August  when Bloomberg  News  mistakenly  released  its  prepackaged\nobituary of Jobs, which ended up on Gawker. Jobs was able to roll out Mark Twain’s\nfamous quip a few days later at his annual music event. “Reports of my death are greatly\nexaggerated,” he said, as he launched a line of new iPods. But his gaunt appearance was\nnot reassuring. By early October the stock price had sunk to $97.\nThat month Doug Morris of Universal Music was scheduled to meet with Jobs at\nApple. Instead Jobs invited him to his house. Morris was surprised to see him so ill and\nin pain. Morris was about to be honored at a gala in Los Angeles for City of Hope,\nwhich raised money to fight cancer, and he wanted Jobs to be there. Charitable events\nwere something Jobs avoided, but he decided to do it, both for Morris and for the cause.\nAt the event, held in a big tent on Santa Monica beach, Morris told the two thousand\nguests that Jobs was giving the music industry a new lease on life. The performances—\nby Stevie Nicks, Lionel Richie, Erykah Badu, and Akon—went on past midnight, and\nJobs had severe chills. Jimmy Iovine gave him a hooded sweatshirt to wear, and he kept\nthe hood over his head all evening. “He was so sick, so cold, so thin,” Morris recalled.\nFortune’s veteran technology writer Brent Schlender was leaving the magazine that\nDecember, and his swan song was to be a joint interview with Jobs, Bill Gates, Andy\nGrove, and Michael Dell. It had been hard to organize, and just a few days before it\nwas to happen, Jobs called to back out. “If they ask why, just tell them I’m an asshole,”\nhe said. Gates was annoyed, then discovered what the health situation was. “Of course,\nhe had a very, very good reason,” said Gates. “He just didn’t want to say.” That became\nmore apparent when Apple announced on December 16 that Jobs was canceling his\nscheduled appearance at the January Macworld, the forum he had used for big product\nlaunches for the past eleven years.\nThe blogosphere erupted with speculation about his health, much of which had the\nodious smell of truth. Jobs was furious and felt violated. He was also annoyed that\nApple wasn’t being more active in pushing back. So on January 5, 2009, he wrote and\n\nreleased a misleading open letter. He claimed that he was skipping Macworld because\nhe wanted to spend more time with his family. “As many of you know, I have been\nlosing weight throughout 2008,” he added. “My doctors think they have found the cause\n—a hormone imbalance that has been robbing me of the proteins my body needs to be\nhealthy. Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis. The remedy for this\nnutritional problem is relatively simple.”\nThere was a kernel of truth to this, albeit a small one. One of the hormones created\nby the pancreas is glucagon, which is the flip side of insulin. Glucagon causes your\nliver to release blood sugar. Jobs’s tumor had metastasized into his liver and was\nwreaking havoc. In effect, his body was devouring itself, so his doctors gave him drugs\nto try to lower the glucagon level. He did have a hormone imbalance, but it was because\nhis cancer had spread into his liver. He was in personal denial about this, and he also\nwanted to be in public denial. Unfortunately that was legally problematic, because he\nran a publicly traded company. But Jobs was furious about the way the blogosphere was\ntreating him, and he wanted to strike back.\nHe was very sick at this point, despite his upbeat statement, and also in excruciating\npain. He had undertaken another round of cancer drug therapy, and it had grueling side\neffects. His skin started drying out and cracking. In his quest for alternative approaches,\nhe flew to Basel, Switzerland, to try an experimental hormone-delivered radiotherapy.\nHe also underwent an experimental treatment developed in Rotterdam known as peptide\nreceptor radionuclide therapy.\nAfter a week filled with increasingly insistent legal advice, Jobs finally agreed to go\non medical leave. He made the announcement on January 14, 2009, in another open\nletter to the Apple staff. At first he blamed the decision on the prying of bloggers and\nthe  press.  “Unfortunately,  the  curiosity  over  my  personal  health  continues  to  be  a\ndistraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple,” he said. But then\nhe admitted that the remedy for his “hormone imbalance” was not as simple as he had\nclaimed. “During the past week I have learned that my health-related issues are more\ncomplex than I originally thought.” Tim Cook would again take over daily operations,\nbut Jobs said that he would remain CEO, continue to be involved in major decisions,\nand be back by June.\nJobs had been consulting with Bill Campbell and Art Levinson, who were juggling\nthe dual roles of being his personal health advisors and also the co-lead directors of the\ncompany. But the rest of the board had not been as fully informed, and the shareholders\nhad initially been misinformed. That raised some legal issues, and the SEC opened an\ninvestigation  into  whether  the  company  had  withheld  “material  information”  from\nshareholders. It would constitute security fraud, a felony, if the company had allowed\nthe dissemination of false information or withheld true information that was relevant to\nthe  company’s  financial  prospects.  Because  Jobs  and  his  magic  were  so  closely\nidentified with Apple’s comeback, his health seemed to meet this standard. But it was a\nmurky area of the law; the privacy rights of the CEO had to be weighed. This balance\n\nwas  particularly  difficult  in  the  case  of  Jobs,  who  both  valued  his  privacy  and\nembodied his company more than most CEOs. He did not make the task easier. He\nbecame very emotional, both ranting and crying at times, when railing against anyone\nwho suggested that he should be less secretive.\nCampbell treasured  his  friendship  with  Jobs,  and  he  didn’t  want  to  have  any\nfiduciary duty to violate his privacy, so he offered to step down as a director. “The\nprivacy side is so important to me,” he later said. “He’s been my friend for about a\nmillion years.” The lawyers eventually determined that Campbell didn’t need to resign\nfrom the board but that he should step aside as co-lead director. He was replaced in that\nrole by Andrea Jung of Avon. The SEC investigation ended up going nowhere, and the\nboard circled the wagons to protect Jobs from calls that he release more information.\n“The press wanted us to blurt out more personal details,” recalled Al Gore. “It was\nreally up to Steve to go beyond what the law requires, but he was adamant that he didn’t\nwant  his  privacy  invaded.  His  wishes  should  be  respected.”  When  I  asked  Gore\nwhether the board should have been more forthcoming at the beginning of 2009, when\nJobs’s health issues were far worse than shareholders were led to believe, he replied,\n“We hired outside counsel to do a review of what the law required and what the best\npractices were, and we handled it all by the book. I sound defensive, but the criticism\nreally pissed me off.”\nOne board member disagreed. Jerry York, the former CFO at Chrysler and IBM, did\nnot say anything publicly, but he confided to a reporter at the Wall Street Journal, off\nthe record, that he was “disgusted” when he learned that the company had concealed\nJobs’s health problems in late 2008. “Frankly, I wish I had resigned then.” When York\ndied in 2010, the Journal put his comments on the record. York had also provided off-\nthe-record information to Fortune, which the magazine used when Jobs went on his\nthird health leave, in 2011.\nSome at Apple didn’t believe the quotes attributed to York were accurate, since he\nhad not officially raised objections at the time. But Bill Campbell knew that the reports\nrang true; York had complained to him in early 2009. “Jerry had a little more white\nwine than he should have late at night, and he would call at two or three in the morning\nand say, ‘What the fuck, I’m not buying that shit about his health, we’ve got to make\nsure.’ And then I’d call him the next morning and he’d say, ‘Oh fine, no problem.’ So on\nsome of those evenings, I’m sure he got raggy and talked to reporters.”\nMemphis\nThe head of Jobs’s oncology team was Stanford University’s George Fisher, a leading\nresearcher on gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers. He had been warning Jobs for\nmonths  that  he  might  have  to  consider  a  liver  transplant,  but  that  was  the  type  of\n\ninformation that Jobs resisted processing. Powell was glad that Fisher kept raising the\npossibility, because she knew it would take repeated proddings to get her husband to\nconsider the idea.\nHe finally became convinced in January 2009, just after he claimed his “hormonal\nimbalance” could be treated easily. But there was a problem. He was put on the wait\nlist for a liver transplant in California, but it became clear he would never get one there\nin time. The number of available donors with his blood type was small. Also, the\nmetrics used by the United Network for Organ Sharing, which establishes policies in the\nUnited States, favored those suffering from cirrhosis and hepatitis over cancer patients.\nThere is no legal way for a patient, even one as wealthy as Jobs, to jump the queue,\nand he didn’t. Recipients are chosen based on their MELD score (Model for End-Stage\nLiver Disease), which uses lab tests of hormone levels to determine how urgently a\ntransplant is needed, and on the length of time they have been waiting. Every donation is\nclosely audited, data are available on public websites (optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/), and\nyou can monitor your status on the wait list at any time.\nPowell became the troller of the organ-donation websites, checking in every night to\nsee how many were on the wait lists, what their MELD scores were, and how long they\nhad been on. “You can do the math, which I did, and it would have been way past June\nbefore he got a liver in California, and the doctors felt that his liver would give out in\nabout April,” she recalled. So she started asking questions and discovered that it was\npermissible to be on the list in two different states at the same time, which is something\nthat about 3% of potential recipients do. Such multiple listing is not discouraged by\npolicy, even though critics say it favors the rich, but it is difficult. There were two\nmajor requirements: The potential recipient had to be able to get to the chosen hospital\nwithin eight hours, which Jobs could do thanks to his plane, and the doctors from that\nhospital had to evaluate the patient in person before adding him or her to the list.\nGeorge Riley,  the  San  Francisco  lawyer  who  often  served  as  Apple’s  outside\ncounsel, was a caring Tennessee gentleman, and he had become close to Jobs. His\nparents had both been doctors at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, he was\nborn there, and he was a friend of James Eason, who ran the transplant institute there.\nEason’s unit was one of the best and busiest in the nation; in 2008 he and his team did\n121 liver transplants. He had no problem allowing people from elsewhere to multiple-\nlist in Memphis. “It’s not gaming the system,” he said. “It’s people choosing where they\nwant their health care. Some people would leave Tennessee to go to California or\nsomewhere else to seek treatment. Now we have people coming from California to\nTennessee.” Riley arranged for Eason to fly to Palo Alto and conduct the required\nevaluation there.\nBy late February 2009 Jobs had secured a place on the Tennessee list (as well as the\none in California), and the nervous waiting began. He was declining rapidly by the first\nweek in March, and the waiting time was projected to be twenty-one days. “It was\ndreadful,” Powell recalled. “It didn’t look like we would make it in time.” Every day\n\nbecame more excruciating. He moved up to third on the list by mid-March, then second,\nand finally first. But then days went by. The awful reality was that upcoming events like\nSt. Patrick’s Day and March Madness (Memphis was in the 2009 tournament and was a\nregional site) offered a greater likelihood of getting a donor because the drinking causes\na spike in car accidents.\nIndeed, on the weekend of March 21, 2009, a young man in his mid-twenties was\nkilled in a car crash, and his organs were made available. Jobs and his wife flew to\nMemphis, where they landed just before 4 a.m. and were met by Eason. A car was\nwaiting on the tarmac, and everything was staged so that the admitting paperwork was\ndone as they rushed to the hospital.\nThe transplant was a success, but not reassuring. When the doctors took out his liver,\nthey found spots on the peritoneum, the thin membrane that surrounds internal organs. In\naddition, there were tumors throughout the liver, which meant it was likely that the\ncancer had migrated elsewhere as well. It had apparently mutated and grown quickly.\nThey took samples and did more genetic mapping.\nA few days later they needed to perform another procedure. Jobs insisted against all\nadvice they not pump out his stomach, and when they sedated him, he aspirated some of\nthe contents into his lungs and developed pneumonia. At that point they thought he might\ndie. As he described it later:\nI almost died because in this routine procedure they blew it. Laurene was there and they\nflew my children in, because they did not think I would make it through the night. Reed\nwas looking at colleges with one of Laurene’s brothers. We had a private plane pick\nhim up near Dartmouth and tell them what was going on. A plane also picked up the\ngirls. They thought it might be the last chance they had to see me conscious. But I made\nit.\nPowell took charge of overseeing the treatment, staying in the hospital room all day\nand watching each of the monitors vigilantly. “Laurene was a beautiful tiger protecting\nhim,” recalled Jony Ive, who came as soon as Jobs could receive visitors. Her mother\nand three brothers came down at various times to keep her company. Jobs’s sister Mona\nSimpson also hovered protectively. She and George Riley were the only people Jobs\nwould allow to fill in for Powell at his bedside. “Laurene’s family helped us take care\nof the kids—her mom and brothers were great,” Jobs later said. “I was very fragile and\nnot cooperative. But an experience like that binds you together in a deep way.”\nPowell came every day at 7 a.m. and gathered the relevant data, which she put on a\nspreadsheet. “It was very complicated because there were a lot of different things going\non,” she recalled. When James Eason and his team of doctors arrived at 9 a.m., she\nwould have a meeting with them to coordinate all aspects of Jobs’s treatment. At 9 p.m.,\n\nbefore she left, she would prepare a report on how each of the vital signs and other\nmeasurements were trending, along with a set of questions she wanted answered the\nnext day. “It allowed me to engage my brain and stay focused,” she recalled.\nEason did what no one at Stanford had fully done: take charge of all aspects of the\nmedical care. Since he ran the facility, he could coordinate the transplant recovery,\ncancer tests, pain treatments, nutrition, rehabilitation, and nursing. He would even stop\nat the convenience store to get the energy drinks Jobs liked.\nTwo of the nurses were from tiny towns in Mississippi, and they became Jobs’s\nfavorites. They were solid family women and not intimidated by him. Eason arranged\nfor them to be assigned only to Jobs. “To manage Steve, you have to be persistent,”\nrecalled Tim Cook. “Eason managed Steve and forced him to do things that no one else\ncould, things that were good for him that may not have been pleasant.”\nDespite all the coddling, Jobs at times almost went crazy. He chafed at not being in\ncontrol, and he sometimes hallucinated or became angry. Even when he was barely\nconscious, his strong personality came through. At one point the pulmonologist tried to\nput a mask over his face when he was deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it off and mumbled\nthat he hated the design and refused to wear it. Though barely able to speak, he ordered\nthem to bring five different options for the mask and he would pick a design he liked.\nThe doctors looked at Powell, puzzled. She was finally able to distract him so they\ncould put on the mask. He also hated the oxygen monitor they put on his finger. He told\nthem it was ugly and too complex. He suggested ways it could be designed more simply.\n“He was very attuned to every nuance of the environment and objects around him, and\nthat drained him,” Powell recalled.\nOne day, when he was still floating in and out of consciousness, Powell’s close\nfriend Kathryn Smith came to visit. Her relationship with Jobs had not always been the\nbest, but Powell insisted that she come by the bedside. He motioned her over, signaled\nfor a pad and pen, and wrote, “I want my iPhone.” Smith took it off the dresser and\nbrought it to him. Taking her hand, he showed her the “swipe to open” function and\nmade her play with the menus.\nJobs’s relationship with Lisa Brennan-Jobs, his daughter with Chrisann, had frayed.\nShe had graduated from Harvard, moved to New York City, and rarely communicated\nwith her father. But she flew down to Memphis twice, and he appreciated it. “It meant a\nlot to me that she would do that,” he recalled. Unfortunately he didn’t tell her at the\ntime. Many of the people around Jobs found Lisa could be as demanding as her father,\nbut Powell welcomed her and tried to get her involved. It was a relationship she wanted\nto restore.\nAs Jobs got better, much of his feisty personality returned. He still had his bile ducts.\n“When he started to recover, he passed quickly through the phase of gratitude, and went\nright back into the mode of being grumpy and in charge,” Kat Smith recalled. “We were\nall wondering if he was going to come out of this with a kinder perspective, but he\ndidn’t.”\n\nHe also remained a finicky eater, which was more of a problem than ever. He would\neat only fruit smoothies, and he would demand that seven or eight of them be lined up so\nhe could find an option that might satisfy him. He would touch the spoon to his mouth for\na tiny taste and pronounce, “That’s no good. That one’s no good either.” Finally Eason\npushed back. “You know, this isn’t a matter of taste,” he lectured. “Stop thinking of this\nas food. Start thinking of it as medicine.”\nJobs’s mood buoyed when he was able to have visitors from Apple. Tim Cook came\ndown regularly and filled him in on the progress of new products. “You could see him\nbrighten every time the talk turned to Apple,” Cook said. “It was like the light turned\non.” He loved the company deeply, and he seemed to live for the prospect of returning.\nDetails would energize him. When Cook described a new model of the iPhone, Jobs\nspent the next hour discussing not only what to call it—they agreed on iPhone 3GS—but\nalso the size and font of the “GS,” including whether the letters should be capitalized\n(yes) and italicized (no).\nOne day Riley arranged a surprise after-hours visit to Sun Studio, the redbrick shrine\nwhere Elvis, Johnny Cash, B.B. King, and many other rock-and-roll pioneers recorded.\nThey were given a private tour and a history lecture by one of the young staffers, who\nsat  with  Jobs  on  the  cigarette-scarred  bench  that  Jerry  Lee  Lewis  used.  Jobs  was\narguably the most influential person in the music industry at the time, but the kid didn’t\nrecognize him in his emaciated state. As they were leaving, Jobs told Riley, “That kid\nwas really smart. We should hire him for iTunes.” So Riley called Eddy Cue, who flew\nthe boy out to California for an interview and ended up hiring him to help build the\nearly R&B and rock-and-roll sections of iTunes. When Riley went back to see his\nfriends at Sun Studio later, they said that it proved, as their slogan said, that your\ndreams can still come true at Sun Studio.\nReturn\nAt the end of May 2009 Jobs flew back from Memphis on his jet with his wife and\nsister. They were met at the San Jose airfield by Tim Cook and Jony Ive, who came\naboard as soon as the plane landed. “You could see in his eyes his excitement at being\nback,” Cook recalled. “He had fight in him and was raring to go.” Powell pulled out a\nbottle of sparkling apple cider and toasted her husband, and everyone embraced.\nIve was emotionally drained. He drove to Jobs’s house from the airport and told him\nhow hard it had been to keep things going while he was away. He also complained\nabout the stories saying that Apple’s innovation depended on Jobs and would disappear\nif he didn’t return. “I’m really hurt,” Ive told him. He felt “devastated,” he said, and\nunderappreciated.\n\nJobs was likewise in a dark mental state after his return to Palo Alto. He was\ncoming to grips with the thought that he might not be indispensable to the company.\nApple stock had fared well while he was away, going from $82 when he announced his\nleave in January 2009 to $140 when he returned at the end of May. On one conference\ncall with analysts shortly after Jobs went on leave, Cook departed from his unemotional\nstyle to give a rousing declaration of why Apple would continue to soar even with Jobs\nabsent:\nWe believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products, and that’s not\nchanging. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the\ncomplex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind\nthe  products  that  we  make,  and  participate  only  in  markets  where  we  can  make  a\nsignificant contribution. We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can\nreally focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep\ncollaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way\nthat others cannot. And frankly, we don’t settle for anything less than excellence in every\ngroup in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we’re wrong and the\ncourage to change. And I think, regardless of who is in what job, those values are so\nembedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well.\nIt sounded like something Jobs would say (and had said), but the press dubbed it “the\nCook doctrine.” Jobs was rankled and deeply depressed, especially about the last line.\nHe didn’t know whether to be proud or hurt that it might be true. There was talk that he\nmight step aside and become chairman rather than CEO. That made him all the more\nmotivated to get out of his bed, overcome the pain, and start taking his restorative long\nwalks again.\nA board meeting was scheduled a few days after he returned, and Jobs surprised\neveryone by making an appearance. He ambled in and was able to stay for most of the\nmeeting. By early June he was holding daily meetings at his house, and by the end of the\nmonth he was back at work.\nWould he now, after facing death, be more mellow? His colleagues quickly got an\nanswer. On his first day back, he startled his top team by throwing a series of tantrums.\nHe ripped apart people he had not seen for six months, tore up some marketing plans,\nand chewed out a couple of people whose work he found shoddy. But what was truly\ntelling was the pronouncement he made to a couple of friends late that afternoon. “I had\nthe greatest time being back today,” he said. “I can’t believe how creative I’m feeling,\nand how the whole team is.” Tim Cook took it in stride. “I’ve never seen Steve hold\nback from expressing his view or passion,” he later said. “But that was good.”\n\nFriends noted that Jobs had retained his feistiness. During his recuperation he signed\nup for Comcast’s high-definition cable service, and one day he called Brian Roberts,\nwho ran the company. “I thought he was calling to say something nice about it,” Roberts\nrecalled. “Instead, he told me ‘It sucks.’” But Andy Hertzfeld noticed that, beneath the\ngruffness, Jobs had become more honest. “Before, if you asked Steve for a favor, he\nmight do the exact opposite,” Hertzfeld said. “That was the perversity in his nature.\nNow he actually tries to be helpful.”\nHis public return came on September 9, when he took the stage at the company’s\nregular fall music event. He got a standing ovation that lasted almost a minute, then he\nopened on an unusually personal note by mentioning that he was the recipient of a liver\ndonation. “I wouldn’t be here without such generosity,” he said, “so I hope all of us can\nbe as generous and elect to become organ donors.” After a moment of exultation—“I’m\nvertical, I’m back at Apple, and I’m loving every day of it”—he unveiled the new line\nof iPod Nanos, with video cameras, in nine different colors of anodized aluminum.\nBy the beginning of 2010 he had recovered most of his strength, and he threw himself\nback into work for what would be one of his, and Apple’s, most productive years. He\nhad hit two consecutive home runs since launching Apple’s digital hub strategy: the\niPod and the iPhone. Now he was going to swing for another.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\nTHE iPAD\nInto the Post-PC Era\nYou Say You Want a Revolution\nBack in 2002, Jobs had been annoyed by the Microsoft engineer who kept proselytizing\nabout the tablet computer software he had developed, which allowed users to input\ninformation on the screen with a stylus or pen. A few manufacturers released tablet PCs\nthat year using the software, but none made a dent in the universe. Jobs had been eager\nto show how it should be done right—no stylus!—but when he saw the multi-touch\ntechnology that Apple was developing, he had decided to use it first to make an iPhone.\nIn the meantime, the tablet idea was percolating within the Macintosh hardware\ngroup. “We have no plans to make a tablet,” Jobs declared in an interview with Walt\nMossberg in May 2003. “It turns out people want keyboards. Tablets appeal to rich guys\nwith  plenty  of  other  PCs  and  devices  already.”  Like  his  statement  about  having  a\n“hormone imbalance,” that was misleading; at most of his annual Top 100 retreats, the\n\ntablet was among the future projects discussed. “We showed the idea off at many of\nthese retreats, because Steve never lost his desire to do a tablet,” Phil Schiller recalled.\nThe tablet project got a boost in 2007 when Jobs was considering ideas for a low-\ncost netbook computer. At an executive team brainstorming session one Monday, Ive\nasked why it needed a keyboard hinged to the screen; that was expensive and bulky. Put\nthe keyboard on the screen using a multi-touch interface, he suggested. Jobs agreed. So\nthe resources were directed to revving up the tablet project rather than designing a\nnetbook.\nThe process began with Jobs and Ive figuring out the right screen size. They had\ntwenty models made—all rounded rectangles, of course—in slightly varying sizes and\naspect ratios. Ive laid them out on a table in the design studio, and in the afternoon they\nwould lift the velvet cloth hiding them and play with them. “That’s how we nailed what\nthe screen size was,” Ive said.\nAs usual Jobs pushed for the purest possible simplicity. That required determining\nwhat was the core essence of the device. The answer: the display screen. So the guiding\nprinciple was that everything they did had to defer to the screen. “How do we get out of\nthe way so there aren’t a ton of features and buttons that distract from the display?” Ive\nasked. At every step, Jobs pushed to remove and simplify.\nAt one point Jobs looked at the model and was slightly dissatisfied. It didn’t feel\ncasual and friendly enough, so that you would naturally scoop it up and whisk it away.\nIve put his finger, so to speak, on the problem: They needed to signal that you could\ngrab it with one hand, on impulse. The bottom of the edge needed to be slightly rounded,\nso that you’d feel comfortable just scooping it up rather than lifting it carefully. That\nmeant engineering had to design the necessary connection ports and buttons in a simple\nlip that was thin enough to wash away gently underneath.\nIf you had been paying attention to patent filings, you would have noticed the one\nnumbered D504889 that Apple applied for in March 2004 and was issued fourteen\nmonths later. Among the inventors listed were Jobs and Ive. The application carried\nsketches of a rectangular electronic tablet with rounded edges, which looked just the\nway the iPad turned out, including one of a man holding it casually in his left hand while\nusing his right index finger to touch the screen.\nSince the Macintosh computers were now using Intel chips, Jobs initially planned to\nuse in the iPad the low-voltage Atom chip that Intel was developing. Paul Otellini,\nIntel’s CEO, was pushing hard to work together on a design, and Jobs’s inclination was\nto trust him. His company was making the fastest processors in the world. But Intel was\nused to making processors for machines that plugged into a wall, not ones that had to\npreserve battery life. So Tony Fadell argued strongly for something based on the ARM\narchitecture, which was simpler and used less power. Apple had been an early partner\nwith ARM, and chips using its architecture were in the original iPhone. Fadell gathered\nsupport from other engineers and proved that it was possible to confront Jobs and turn\nhim around. “Wrong, wrong, wrong!” Fadell shouted at one meeting when Jobs insisted\n\nit was best to trust Intel to make a good mobile chip. Fadell even put his Apple badge\non the table, threatening to resign.\nEventually Jobs relented. “I hear you,” he said. “I’m not going to go against my best\nguys.” In fact he went to the other extreme. Apple licensed the ARM architecture, but it\nalso bought a 150-person microprocessor design firm in Palo Alto, called P.A. Semi,\nand had it create a custom system-on-a-chip, called the A4, which was based on the\nARM architecture and manufactured in South Korea by Samsung. As Jobs recalled:\nAt the high-performance end, Intel is the best. They build the fastest chip, if you don’t\ncare about power and cost. But they build just the processor on one chip, so it takes a\nlot of other parts. Our A4 has the processor and the graphics, mobile operating system,\nand memory control all in the chip. We tried to help Intel, but they don’t listen much.\nWe’ve been telling them for years that their graphics suck. Every quarter we schedule a\nmeeting with me and our top three guys and Paul Otellini. At the beginning, we were\ndoing wonderful things together. They wanted this big joint project to do chips for future\niPhones. There were two reasons we didn’t go with them. One was that they are just\nreally slow. They’re like a steamship, not very flexible. We’re used to going pretty fast.\nSecond is that we just didn’t want to teach them everything, which they could go and\nsell to our competitors.\nAccording to Otellini, it would have made sense for the iPad to use Intel chips. The\nproblem, he said, was that Apple and Intel couldn’t agree on price. Also, they disagreed\non who would control the design. It was another example of Jobs’s desire, indeed\ncompulsion, to control every aspect of a product, from the silicon to the flesh.\nThe Launch, January 2010\n\nThe  usual  excitement  that  Jobs  was  able  to  gin  up  for  a  product  launch  paled  in\ncomparison to the frenzy that built for the iPad unveiling on January 27, 2010, in San\nFrancisco. The Economist put him on its cover robed, haloed, and holding what was\ndubbed “the Jesus Tablet.” The Wall Street Journal struck a similarly exalted note:\n“The  last  time  there  was  this  much  excitement  about  a  tablet,  it  had  some\ncommandments written on it.”\nAs if to underscore the historic nature of the launch, Jobs invited back many of the\nold-timers  from  his  early  Apple  days.  More  poignantly,  James  Eason,  who  had\nperformed his liver transplant the year before, and Jeffrey Norton, who had operated on\nhis pancreas in 2004, were in the audience, sitting with his wife, his son, and Mona\nSimpson.\nJobs did his usual masterly job of putting a new device into context, as he had done\nfor the iPhone three years earlier. This time he put up a screen that showed an iPhone\nand a laptop with a question mark in between. “The question is, is there room for\nsomething in the middle?” he asked. That “something” would have to be good at web\nbrowsing, email, photos, video, music, games, and ebooks. He drove a stake through the\nheart of the netbook concept. “Netbooks aren’t better at anything!” he said. The invited\nguests and employees cheered. “But we have something that is. We call it the iPad.”\nTo underscore the casual nature of the iPad, Jobs ambled over to a comfortable\nleather chair and side table (actually, given his taste, it was a Le Corbusier chair and an\nEero Saarinen table) and scooped one up. “It’s so much more intimate than a laptop,” he\nenthused. He proceeded to surf to the New York Times website, send an email to Scott\nForstall and Phil Schiller (“Wow, we really are announcing the iPad”), flip through a\nphoto album, use a calendar, zoom in on the Eiffel Tower on Google Maps, watch some\nvideo clips (Star Trek and Pixar’s Up), show off the iBook shelf, and play a song (Bob\nDylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone,” which he had played at the iPhone launch). “Isn’t that\nawesome?” he asked.\nWith his final slide, Jobs emphasized one of the themes of his life, which was\nembodied by the iPad: a sign showing the corner of Technology Street and Liberal Arts\nStreet. “The reason Apple can create products like the iPad is that we’ve always tried\nto be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts,” he concluded. The iPad was the\ndigital reincarnation of the Whole Earth Catalog, the place where creativity met tools\nfor living.\nFor once, the initial reaction was not a Hallelujah Chorus. The iPad was not yet\navailable (it would go on sale in April), and some who watched Jobs’s demo were not\nquite sure what it was. An iPhone on steroids? “I haven’t been this let down since\nSnooki  hooked  up  with  The  Situation,”  wrote Newsweek’s  Daniel  Lyons  (who\nmoonlighted  as  “The  Fake  Steve  Jobs”  in  an  online  parody).  Gizmodo  ran  a\ncontributor’s piece headlined “Eight Things That Suck about the iPad” (no multitasking,\nno cameras, no Flash ... ). Even the name came in for ridicule in the blogosphere, with\n\nsnarky  comments  about  feminine  hygiene  products  and  maxi  pads.  The  hashtag\n“#iTampon” was the number-three trending topic on Twitter that day.\nThere was also the requisite dismissal from Bill Gates. “I still think that some\nmixture of voice, the pen and a real keyboard—in other words a netbook—will be the\nmainstream,” he told Brent Schlender. “So, it’s not like I sit there and feel the same way\nI did with the iPhone where I say, ‘Oh my God, Microsoft didn’t aim high enough.’ It’s a\nnice reader, but there’s nothing on the iPad I look at and say, ‘Oh, I wish Microsoft had\ndone it.’” He continued to insist that the Microsoft approach of using a stylus for input\nwould prevail. “I’ve been predicting a tablet with a stylus for many years,” he told me.\n“I will eventually turn out to be right or be dead.”\nThe night after his announcement, Jobs was annoyed and depressed. As we gathered\nin his kitchen for dinner, he paced around the table calling up emails and web pages on\nhis iPhone.\nI got about eight hundred email messages in the last twenty-four hours. Most of them are\ncomplaining. There’s no USB cord! There’s no this, no that. Some of them are like,\n“Fuck you, how can you do that?” I don’t usually write people back, but I replied, “Your\nparents would be so proud of how you turned out.” And some don’t like the iPad name,\nand on and on. I kind of got depressed today. It knocks you back a bit.\nHe  did  get  one  congratulatory  call  that  day  that  he  appreciated,  from  President\nObama’s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. But he noted at dinner that the president had not\ncalled him since taking office.\nThe public carping subsided when the iPad went on sale in April and people got their\nhands on it. Both Time and Newsweek put it on the cover. “The tough thing about writing\nabout Apple products is that they come with a lot of hype wrapped around them,” Lev\nGrossman wrote in Time. “The other tough thing about writing about Apple products is\nthat sometimes the hype is true.” His main reservation, a substantive one, was “that\nwhile it’s a lovely device for consuming content, it doesn’t do much to facilitate its\ncreation.” Computers, especially the Macintosh, had become tools that allowed people\nto make music, videos, websites, and blogs, which could be posted for the world to see.\n“The  iPad  shifts  the  emphasis  from  creating  content  to  merely  absorbing  and\nmanipulating it. It mutes you, turns you back into a passive consumer of other people’s\nmasterpieces.” It was a criticism Jobs took to heart. He set about making sure that the\nnext version of the iPad would emphasize ways to facilitate artistic creation by the user.\nNewsweek’s cover line was “What’s So Great about the iPad? Everything.” Daniel\nLyons, who had zapped it with his “Snooki” comment at the launch, revised his opinion.\n\n“My first thought, as I watched Jobs run through his demo, was that it seemed like no\nbig deal,” he wrote. “It’s a bigger version of the iPod Touch, right? Then I got a chance\nto use an iPad, and it hit me: I want one.” Lyons, like others, realized that this was\nJobs’s pet project, and it embodied all that he stood for. “He has an uncanny ability to\ncook up gadgets that we didn’t know we needed, but then suddenly can’t live without,”\nhe wrote. “A closed system may be the only way to deliver the kind of techno-Zen\nexperience that Apple has become known for.”\nMost of the debate over the iPad centered on the issue of whether its closed end-to-\nend integration was brilliant or doomed. Google was starting to play a role similar to\nthe one Microsoft had played in the 1980s, offering a mobile platform, Android, that\nwas open and could be used by all hardware makers. Fortune staged a debate on this\nissue in its pages. “There’s no excuse to be closed,” wrote Michael Copeland. But his\ncolleague Jon Fortt rebutted, “Closed systems get a bad rap, but they work beautifully\nand users benefit. Probably no one in tech has proved this more convincingly than Steve\nJobs. By bundling hardware, software, and services, and controlling them tightly, Apple\nis consistently able to get the jump on its rivals and roll out polished products.” They\nagreed  that  the  iPad  would  be  the  clearest  test  of  this  question  since  the  original\nMacintosh. “Apple has taken its control-freak rep to a whole new level with the A4\nchip that powers the thing,” wrote Fortt. “Cupertino now has absolute say over the\nsilicon, device, operating system, App Store, and payment system.”\nJobs went to the Apple store in Palo Alto shortly before noon on April 5, the day the\niPad went on sale. Daniel Kottke—his acid-dropping soul mate from Reed and the early\ndays at Apple, who no longer harbored a grudge for not getting founders’ stock options\n—made a point of being there. “It had been fifteen years, and I wanted to see him\nagain,” Kottke recounted. “I grabbed him and told him I was going to use the iPad for\nmy song lyrics. He was in a great mood and we had a nice chat after all these years.”\nPowell and their youngest child, Eve, watched from a corner of the store.\nWozniak, who had once been a proponent of making hardware and software as open\nas possible, continued to revise that opinion. As he often did, he stayed up all night with\nthe enthusiasts waiting in line for the store to open. This time he was at San Jose’s\nValley Fair Mall, riding a Segway. A reporter asked him about the closed nature of\nApple’s ecosystem. “Apple gets you into their playpen and keeps you there, but there\nare some advantages to that,” he replied. “I like open systems, but I’m a hacker. But\nmost people want things that are easy to use. Steve’s genius is that he knows how to\nmake things simple, and that sometimes requires controlling everything.”\nThe question  “What’s  on  your  iPad?”  replaced  “What’s  on  your  iPod?”  Even\nPresident Obama’s staffers, who embraced the iPad as a mark of their tech hipness,\nplayed  the  game.  Economic  Advisor  Larry  Summers  had  the  Bloomberg  financial\ninformation app, Scrabble, and The Federalist Papers. Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel\nhad a slew of newspapers, Communications Advisor Bill Burton had Vanity Fair and\n\none entire season of the television series Lost, and Political Director David Axelrod\nhad Major League Baseball and NPR.\nJobs  was  stirred  by  a  story,  which  he  forwarded  to  me,  by  Michael  Noer  on\nForbes.com. Noer was reading a science fiction novel on his iPad while staying at a\ndairy farm in a rural area north of Bogotá, Colombia, when a poor six-year-old boy\nwho cleaned the stables came up to him. Curious, Noer handed him the device. With no\ninstruction, and never having seen a computer before, the boy started using it intuitively.\nHe began swiping the screen, launching apps, playing a pinball game. “Steve Jobs has\ndesigned  a  powerful  computer  that  an  illiterate  six-year-old  can  use  without\ninstruction,” Noer wrote. “If that isn’t magical, I don’t know what is.”\nIn less than a month Apple sold one million iPads. That was twice as fast as it took\nthe iPhone to reach that mark. By March 2011, nine months after its release, fifteen\nmillion had been sold. By some measures it became the most successful consumer\nproduct launch in history.\nAdvertising\nJobs was not happy with the original ads for the iPad. As usual, he threw himself into\nthe marketing, working with James Vincent and Duncan Milner at the ad agency (now\ncalled TBWA/Media Arts Lab), with Lee Clow advising from a semiretired perch. The\ncommercial  they  first  produced  was  a  gentle  scene  of  a  guy  in  faded  jeans  and\nsweatshirt reclining in a chair, looking at email, a photo album, the New York Times,\nbooks,  and  video  on  an  iPad  propped  on  his  lap.  There  were  no  words,  just  the\nbackground beat of “There Goes My Love” by the Blue Van. “After he approved it,\nSteve decided he hated it,” Vincent recalled. “He thought it looked like a Pottery Barn\ncommercial.” Jobs later told me:\nIt had been easy to explain what the iPod was—a thousand songs in your pocket—\nwhich allowed us to move quickly to the iconic silhouette ads. But it was hard to\nexplain what an iPad was. We didn’t want to show it as a computer, and yet we didn’t\nwant to make it so soft that it looked like a cute TV. The first set of ads showed we\ndidn’t know what we were doing. They had a cashmere and Hush Puppies feel to them.\nJames Vincent had not taken a break in months. So when the iPad finally went on\nsale and the ads started airing, he drove with his family to the Coachella Music Festival\nin Palm Springs, which featured some of his favorite bands, including Muse, Faith No\nMore, and Devo. Soon after he arrived, Jobs called. “Your commercials suck,” he said.\n\n“The iPad is revolutionizing the world, and we need something big. You’ve given me\nsmall shit.”\n“Well, what do you want?” Vincent shot back. “You’ve not been able to tell me what\nyou want.”\n“I don’t know,” Jobs said. “You have to bring me something new. Nothing you’ve\nshown me is even close.”\nVincent argued back and suddenly Jobs went ballistic. “He just started screaming at\nme,” Vincent recalled. Vincent could be volatile himself, and the volleys escalated.\nWhen Vincent shouted, “You’ve got to tell me what you want,” Jobs shot back,\n“You’ve got to show me some stuff, and I’ll know it when I see it.”\n“Oh, great, let me write that on my brief for my creative people: I’ll know it when I\nsee it.”\nVincent got so frustrated that he slammed his fist into the wall of the house he was\nrenting and put a large dent in it. When he finally went outside to his family, sitting by\nthe pool, they looked at him nervously. “Are you okay?” his wife finally asked.\nIt took Vincent and his team two weeks to come up with an array of new options, and\nhe asked to present them at Jobs’s house rather than the office, hoping that it would be a\nmore  relaxed  environment.  Laying  storyboards  on  the  coffee  table,  he  and  Milner\noffered twelve approaches. One was inspirational and stirring. Another tried humor,\nwith Michael Cera, the comic actor, wandering through a fake house making funny\ncomments  about  the  way  people  could  use  iPads.  Others  featured  the  iPad  with\ncelebrities, or set starkly on a white background, or starring in a little sitcom, or in a\nstraightforward product demonstration.\nAfter mulling over the options, Jobs realized what he wanted. Not humor, nor a\ncelebrity,  nor  a  demo.  “It’s  got  to  make  a  statement,”  he  said.  “It  needs  to  be  a\nmanifesto. This is big.” He had announced that the iPad would change the world, and he\nwanted a campaign that reinforced that declaration. Other companies would come out\nwith copycat tablets in a year or so, he said, and he wanted people to remember that the\niPad was the real thing. “We need ads that stand up and declare what we have done.”\nHe abruptly got out of his chair, looking a bit weak but smiling. “I’ve got to go have\na massage now,” he said. “Get to work.”\nSo Vincent and Milner, along with the copywriter Eric Grunbaum, began crafting\nwhat they dubbed “The Manifesto.” It would be fast-paced, with vibrant pictures and a\nthumping beat, and it would proclaim that the iPad was revolutionary. The music they\nchose was Karen O’s pounding refrain from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ “Gold Lion.” As the\niPad was shown doing magical things, a strong voice declared, “iPad is thin. iPad is\nbeautiful. ... It’s crazy powerful. It’s magical. ... It’s video, photos. More books than\nyou could read in a lifetime. It’s already a revolution, and it’s only just begun.”\nOnce the Manifesto ads had run their course, the team again tried something softer,\nshot as day-in-the-life documentaries by the young filmmaker Jessica Sanders, who had\ndirected the Manifesto ones. Jobs liked them—for a little while. Then he turned against\n\nthem for the same reason he had reacted against the original Pottery Barn–style ads.\n“Dammit,” he shouted, “they look like a Visa commercial, typical ad agency stuff.”\nHe had been asking for ads that were different and new, but eventually he realized he\ndid not want to stray from what he considered the Apple voice. For him, that voice had\na distinctive set of qualities: simple, declarative, clean. “We went down that lifestyle\npath, and it seemed to be growing on Steve, and suddenly he said, ‘I hate that stuff, it’s\nnot Apple,’” recalled Lee Clow. “He told us to get back to the Apple voice. It’s a very\nsimple, honest voice.” And so they went back to a clean white background, with just a\nclose-up showing off all the things that “iPad is ...” and could do.\nApps\nThe iPad commercials were not about the device, but about what you could do with it.\nIndeed  its  success  came  not  just  from  the  beauty  of  the  hardware  but  from  the\napplications,  known  as  apps,  that  allowed  you  to  indulge  in  all  sorts  of  delightful\nactivities. There were thousands—and soon hundreds of thousands—of apps that you\ncould download for free or for a few dollars. You could sling angry birds with the\nswipe of your finger, track your stocks, watch movies, read books and magazines, catch\nup  on  the  news,  play  games,  and  waste  glorious  amounts  of  time.  Once  again  the\nintegration of the hardware, software, and store made it easy. But the apps also allowed\nthe platform to be sort of open, in a very controlled way, to outside developers who\nwanted to create software and content for it—open, that is, like a carefully curated and\ngated community garden.\nThe apps phenomenon began with the iPhone. When it first came out in early 2007,\nthere were no apps you could buy from outside developers, and Jobs initially resisted\nallowing them. He didn’t want outsiders to create applications for the iPhone that could\nmess it up, infect it with viruses, or pollute its integrity.\nBoard member Art Levinson was among those pushing to allow iPhone apps. “I\ncalled him a half dozen times to lobby for the potential of the apps,” he recalled. If\nApple didn’t allow them, indeed encourage them, another smartphone maker would,\ngiving itself a competitive advantage. Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller agreed. “I\ncouldn’t imagine that we would create something as powerful as the iPhone and not\nempower developers to make lots of apps,” he recalled. “I knew customers would love\nthem.” From the outside, the venture capitalist John Doerr argued that permitting apps\nwould spawn a profusion of new entrepreneurs who would create new services.\nJobs at first quashed the discussion, partly because he felt his team did not have the\nbandwidth to figure out all of the complexities that would be involved in policing third-\nparty app developers. He wanted focus. “So he didn’t want to talk about it,” said\nSchiller. But as soon as the iPhone was launched, he was willing to hear the debate.\n\n“Every  time  the  conversation  happened,  Steve  seemed  a  little  more  open,”  said\nLevinson. There were freewheeling discussions at four board meetings.\nJobs soon figured out that there was a way to have the best of both worlds. He\nwould permit outsiders to write apps, but they would have to meet strict standards, be\ntested and approved by Apple, and be sold only through the iTunes Store. It was a way\nto reap the advantage of empowering thousands of software developers while retaining\nenough control to protect the integrity of the iPhone and the simplicity of the customer\nexperience.  “It  was  an  absolutely  magical  solution  that  hit  the  sweet  spot,”  said\nLevinson. “It gave us the benefits of openness while retaining end-to-end control.”\nThe App Store for the iPhone opened on iTunes in July 2008; the billionth download\ncame nine months later. By the time the iPad went on sale in April 2010, there were\n185,000 available iPhone apps. Most could also be used on the iPad, although they\ndidn’t take advantage of the bigger screen size. But in less than five months, developers\nhad written twenty-five thousand new apps that were specifically configured for the\niPad. By July 2011 there were 500,000 apps for both devices, and there had been more\nthan fifteen billion downloads of them.\nThe App Store created a new industry overnight. In dorm rooms and garages and at\nmajor media companies, entrepreneurs invented new apps. John Doerr’s venture capital\nfirm created an iFund of $200 million to offer equity financing for the best ideas.\nMagazines and newspapers that had been giving away their content for free saw one last\nchance to put the genie of that dubious business model back into the bottle. Innovative\npublishers created new magazines, books, and learning materials just for the iPad. For\nexample, the high-end publishing house Callaway, which had produced books ranging\nfrom Madonna’s Sex to Miss Spider’s Tea Party, decided to “burn the boats” and give\nup print altogether to focus on publishing books as interactive apps. By June 2011\nApple had paid out $2.5 billion to app developers.\nThe iPad and other app-based digital devices heralded a fundamental shift in the\ndigital world. Back in the 1980s, going online usually meant dialing into a service like\nAOL,  CompuServe,  or  Prodigy  that  charged  fees  for  access  to  a  carefully  curated\nwalled garden filled with content plus some exit gates that allowed braver users access\nto the Internet at large. The second phase, beginning in the early 1990s, was the advent\nof browsers that allowed everyone to freely surf the Internet using the hypertext transfer\nprotocols of the World Wide Web, which linked billions of sites. Search engines arose\nso that people could easily find the websites they wanted. The release of the iPad\nportended a new model. Apps resembled the walled gardens of old. The creators could\ncharge fees and offer more functions to the users who downloaded them. But the rise of\napps also meant that the openness and linked nature of the web were sacrificed. Apps\nwere not as easily linked or searchable. Because the iPad allowed the use of both apps\nand web browsing, it was not at war with the web model. But it did offer an alternative,\nfor both the consumers and the creators of content.\n\nPublishing and Journalism\nWith the iPod, Jobs had transformed the music business. With the iPad and its App\nStore, he began to transform all media, from publishing to journalism to television and\nmovies.\nBooks were an obvious target, since Amazon’s Kindle had shown there was an\nappetite for electronic books. So Apple created an iBooks Store, which sold electronic\nbooks the way the iTunes Store sold songs. There was, however, a slight difference in\nthe business model. For the iTunes Store, Jobs had insisted that all songs be sold at one\ninexpensive price, initially 99 cents. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos had tried to take a similar\napproach with ebooks, insisting on selling them for at most $9.99. Jobs came in and\noffered publishers what he had refused to offer record companies: They could set any\nprice they wanted for their wares in the iBooks Store, and Apple would take 30%.\nInitially that meant prices were higher than on Amazon. Why would people pay Apple\nmore? “That won’t be the case,” Jobs answered, when Walt Mossberg asked him that\nquestion at the iPad launch event. “The price will be the same.” He was right.\nThe day after the iPad launch, Jobs described to me his thinking on books:\nAmazon screwed it up. It paid the wholesale price for some books, but started selling\nthem below cost at $9.99. The publishers hated that—they thought it would trash their\nability to sell hardcover books at $28. So before Apple even got on the scene, some\nbooksellers were starting to withhold books from Amazon. So we told the publishers,\n“We’ll go to the agency model, where you set the price, and we get our 30%, and yes,\nthe customer pays a little more, but that’s what you want anyway.” But we also asked\nfor a guarantee that if anybody else is selling the books cheaper than we are, then we\ncan sell them at the lower price too. So they went to Amazon and said, “You’re going to\nsign an agency contract or we’re not going to give you the books.”\nJobs acknowledged that he was trying to have it both ways when it came to music\nand books. He had refused to offer the music companies the agency model and allow\nthem to set their own prices. Why? Because he didn’t have to. But with books he did.\n“We were not the first people in the books business,” he said. “Given the situation that\nexisted, what was best for us was to do this aikido move and end up with the agency\nmodel. And we pulled it off.”\nRight after the iPad launch event, Jobs traveled to New York in February 2010 to meet\nwith executives in the journalism business. In two days he saw Rupert Murdoch, his son\nJames, and the management of their Wall Street Journal; Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and the\n\ntop executives at the New York Times; and executives at Time, Fortune, and other Time\nInc. magazines. “I would love to help quality journalism,” he later said. “We can’t\ndepend on bloggers for our news. We need real reporting and editorial oversight more\nthan ever. So I’d love to find a way to help people create digital products where they\nactually can make money.” Since he had gotten people to pay for music, he hoped he\ncould do the same for journalism.\nPublishers, however, turned out to be leery of his lifeline. It meant that they would\nhave to give 30% of their revenue to Apple, but that wasn’t the biggest problem. More\nimportant, the publishers feared that, under his system, they would no longer have a\ndirect relationship with their subscribers; they wouldn’t have their email address and\ncredit card number so they could bill them, communicate with them, and market new\nproducts to them. Instead Apple would own the customers, bill them, and have their\ninformation in its own database. And because of its privacy policy, Apple would not\nshare this information unless a customer gave explicit permission to do so.\nJobs was particularly interested in striking a deal with the New York Times, which\nhe felt was a great newspaper in danger of declining because it had not figured out how\nto charge for digital content. “One of my personal projects this year, I’ve decided, is to\ntry to help—whether they want it or not—the Times,” he told me early in 2010. “I think\nit’s important to the country for them to figure it out.”\nDuring his New York trip, he went to dinner with fifty top Times executives in the\ncellar  private  dining  room  at  Pranna,  an  Asian  restaurant.  (He  ordered  a  mango\nsmoothie and a plain vegan pasta, neither of which was on the menu.) There he showed\noff the iPad and explained how important it was to find a modest price point for digital\ncontent that consumers would accept. He drew a chart of possible prices and volume.\nHow many readers would they have if the Times were free? They already knew the\nanswer to that extreme on the chart, because they were giving it away for free on the\nweb already and had about twenty million regular visitors. And if they made it really\nexpensive? They had data on that too; they charged print subscribers more than $300 a\nyear and had about a million of them. “You should go after the midpoint, which is about\nten million digital subscribers,” he told them. “And that means your digital subs should\nbe very cheap and simple, one click and $5 a month at most.”\nWhen one of the Times circulation executives insisted that the paper needed the\nemail and credit card information for all of its subscribers, even if they subscribed\nthrough the App Store, Jobs said that Apple would not give it out. That angered the\nexecutive. It was unthinkable, he said, for the Times not to have that information. “Well,\nyou can ask them for it, but if they won’t voluntarily give it to you, don’t blame me,”\nJobs said. “If you don’t like it, don’t use us. I’m not the one who got you in this jam.\nYou’re the ones who’ve spent the past five years giving away your paper online and not\ncollecting anyone’s credit card information.”\nJobs also met privately with Arthur Sulzberger Jr. “He’s a nice guy, and he’s really\nproud of his new building, as he should be,” Jobs said later. “I talked to him about what\n\nI thought he ought to do, but then nothing happened.” It took a year, but in April 2011 the\nTimes started charging for its digital edition and selling some subscriptions through\nApple, abiding by the policies that Jobs established. It did, however, decide to charge\napproximately four times the $5 monthly charge that Jobs had suggested.\nAt  the  Time-Life  Building, Time’s  editor  Rick  Stengel  played  host.  Jobs  liked\nStengel, who had assigned a talented team led by Josh Quittner to make a robust iPad\nversion of the magazine each week. But he was upset to see Andy Serwer of Fortune\nthere. Tearing up, he told Serwer how angry he still was about Fortune’s story two\nyears earlier revealing details of his health and the stock options problems. “You kicked\nme when I was down,” he said.\nThe bigger problem at Time Inc. was the same as the one at the Times: The magazine\ncompany did not want Apple to own its subscribers and prevent it from having a direct\nbilling relationship. Time Inc. wanted to create apps that would direct readers to its\nown  website  in  order  to  buy  a  subscription.  Apple  refused.  When Time  and  other\nmagazines submitted apps that did this, they were denied the right to be in the App\nStore.\nJobs tried to negotiate personally with the CEO of Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, a\nsavvy pragmatist with a no-bullshit charm to him. They had dealt with each other a few\nyears earlier over video rights for the iPod Touch; even though Jobs had not been able\nto convince him to do a deal involving HBO’s exclusive rights to show movies soon\nafter  their  release,  he  admired  Bewkes’s  straight  and  decisive  style.  For  his  part,\nBewkes respected Jobs’s ability to be both a strategic thinker and a master of the tiniest\ndetails. “Steve can go readily from the overarching principles into the details,” he said.\nWhen Jobs called Bewkes about making a deal for Time Inc. magazines on the iPad,\nhe started off by warning that the print business “sucks,” that “nobody really wants your\nmagazines,”  and  that  Apple  was  offering  a  great  opportunity  to  sell  digital\nsubscriptions, but “your guys don’t get it.” Bewkes didn’t agree with any of those\npremises. He said he was happy for Apple to sell digital subscriptions for Time Inc.\nApple’s 30% take was not the problem. “I’m telling you right now, if you sell a sub for\nus, you can have 30%,” Bewkes told him.\n“Well, that’s more progress than I’ve made with anybody,” Jobs replied.\n“I have only one question,” Bewkes continued. “If you sell a subscription to my\nmagazine, and I give you the 30%, who has the subscription—you or me?”\n“I can’t give away all the subscriber info because of Apple’s privacy policy,” Jobs\nreplied.\n“Well, then, we have to figure something else out, because I don’t want my whole\nsubscription base to become subscribers of yours, for you to then aggregate at the Apple\nstore,” said Bewkes. “And the next thing you’ll do, once you have a monopoly, is come\nback and tell me that my magazine shouldn’t be $4 a copy but instead should be $1. If\nsomeone subscribes to our magazine, we need to know who it is, we need to be able to\n\ncreate online communities of those people, and we need the right to pitch them directly\nabout renewing.”\nJobs had an easier time with Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owned the Wall\nStreet Journal, New York Post, newspapers around the world, Fox Studios, and the Fox\nNews Channel. When Jobs met with Murdoch and his team, they also pressed the case\nthat they should share ownership of the subscribers that came in through the App Store.\nBut when Jobs refused, something interesting happened. Murdoch is not known as a\npushover, but he knew that he did not have the leverage on this issue, so he accepted\nJobs’s  terms.  “We  would  prefer  to  own  the  subscribers,  and  we  pushed  for  that,”\nrecalled Murdoch. “But Steve wouldn’t do a deal on those terms, so I said, ‘Okay, let’s\nget on with it.’ We didn’t see any reason to mess around. He wasn’t going to bend—and\nI wouldn’t have bent if I were in his position—so I just said yes.”\nMurdoch  even  launched  a  digital-only  daily  newspaper, The  Daily,  tailored\nspecifically for the iPad. It would be sold in the App Store, on the terms dictated by\nJobs,  at  99  cents  a  week.  Murdoch  himself  took  a  team  to  Cupertino  to  show  the\nproposed design. Not surprisingly, Jobs hated it. “Would you allow our designers to\nhelp?” he asked. Murdoch accepted. “The Apple designers had a crack at it,” Murdoch\nrecalled, “and our folks went back and had another crack, and ten days later we went\nback and showed them both, and he actually liked our team’s version better. It stunned\nus.”\nThe Daily, which was neither tabloidy nor serious, but instead a rather midmarket\nproduct like USA Today, was not very successful. But it did help create an odd-couple\nbonding between Jobs and Murdoch. When Murdoch asked him to speak at his June\n2010 News Corp. annual management retreat, Jobs made an exception to his rule of\nnever doing such appearances. James Murdoch led him in an after-dinner interview that\nlasted almost two hours. “He was very blunt and critical of what newspapers were\ndoing in technology,” Murdoch recalled. “He told us we were going to find it hard to get\nthings right, because you’re in New York, and anyone who’s any good at tech works in\nSilicon Valley.” This did not go down very well with the president of the Wall Street\nJournal Digital Network, Gordon McLeod, who pushed back a bit. At the end, McLeod\ncame up to Jobs and said, “Thanks, it was a wonderful evening, but you probably just\ncost me my job.” Murdoch chuckled a bit when he described the scene to me. “It ended\nup being true,” he said. McLeod was out within three months.\nIn return for speaking at the retreat, Jobs got Murdoch to hear him out on Fox News,\nwhich he believed was destructive, harmful to the nation, and a blot on Murdoch’s\nreputation. “You’re blowing it with Fox News,” Jobs told him over dinner. “The axis\ntoday is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and you’ve\ncast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly destructive\nforce in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be your legacy if you’re not\ncareful.” Jobs said he thought Murdoch did not really like how far Fox had gone.\n\n“Rupert’s a builder, not a tearer-downer,” he said. “I’ve had some meetings with James,\nand I think he agrees with me. I can just tell.”\nMurdoch later said he was used to people like Jobs complaining about Fox. “He’s\ngot sort of a left-wing view on this,” he said. Jobs asked him to have his folks make a\nreel of a week of Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck shows—he thought that they were more\ndestructive than Bill O’Reilly—and Murdoch agreed to do so. Jobs later told me that he\nwas going to ask Jon Stewart’s team to put together a similar reel for Murdoch to watch.\n“I’d be happy to see it,” Murdoch said, “but he hasn’t sent it to me.”\nMurdoch and Jobs hit it off well enough that Murdoch went to his Palo Alto house\nfor dinner twice more during the next year. Jobs joked that he had to hide the dinner\nknives on such occasions, because he was afraid that his liberal wife was going to\neviscerate Murdoch when he walked in. For his part, Murdoch was reported to have\nuttered a great line about the organic vegan dishes typically served: “Eating dinner at\nSteve’s is a great experience, as long as you get out before the local restaurants close.”\nAlas, when I asked Murdoch if he had ever said that, he didn’t recall it.\nOne  visit  came  early  in  2011.  Murdoch  was  due  to  pass  through  Palo  Alto  on\nFebruary 24, and he texted Jobs to tell him so. He didn’t know it was Jobs’s fifty-sixth\nbirthday, and Jobs didn’t mention it when he texted back inviting him to dinner. “It was\nmy way of making sure Laurene didn’t veto the plan,” Jobs joked. “It was my birthday,\nso she had to let me have Rupert over.” Erin and Eve were there, and Reed jogged over\nfrom Stanford near the end of the dinner. Jobs showed off the designs for his planned\nboat, which Murdoch thought looked beautiful on the inside but “a bit plain” on the\noutside. “It certainly shows great optimism about his health that he was talking so much\nabout building it,” Murdoch later said.\nAt dinner they talked about the importance of infusing an entrepreneurial and nimble\nculture into a company. Sony failed to do that, Murdoch said. Jobs agreed. “I used to\nbelieve that a really big company couldn’t have a clear corporate culture,” Jobs said.\n“But I now believe it can be done. Murdoch’s done it. I think I’ve done it at Apple.”\nMost of the dinner conversation was about education. Murdoch had just hired Joel\nKlein, the former chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, to start a\ndigital curriculum division. Murdoch recalled that Jobs was somewhat dismissive of\nthe idea that technology could transform education. But Jobs agreed with Murdoch that\nthe paper textbook business would be blown away by digital learning materials.\nIn  fact  Jobs  had  his  sights  set  on  textbooks  as  the  next  business  he  wanted  to\ntransform. He believed it was an $8 billion a year industry ripe for digital destruction.\nHe was also struck by the fact that many schools, for security reasons, don’t have\nlockers, so kids have to lug a heavy backpack around. “The iPad would solve that,” he\nsaid. His idea was to hire great textbook writers to create digital versions, and make\nthem a feature of the iPad. In addition, he held meetings with the major publishers, such\nas  Pearson  Education,  about  partnering  with  Apple.  “The  process  by  which  states\ncertify textbooks is corrupt,” he said. “But if we can make the textbooks free, and they\n\ncome with the iPad, then they don’t have to be certified. The crappy economy at the\nstate level will last for a decade, and we can give them an opportunity to circumvent\nthat whole process and save money.”\n\nCHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\nNEW BATTLES\nAnd Echoes of Old Ones\nGoogle: Open versus Closed\nA few days after he unveiled the iPad in January 2010, Jobs held a “town hall” meeting\nwith employees at Apple’s campus. Instead of exulting about their transformative new\nproduct, however, he went into a rant against Google for producing the rival Android\noperating system. Jobs was furious that Google had decided to compete with Apple in\nthe phone business. “We did not enter the search business,” he said. “They entered the\nphone business. Make no mistake. They want to kill the iPhone. We won’t let them.” A\nfew minutes later, after the meeting moved on to another topic, Jobs returned to his\ntirade to attack Google’s famous values slogan. “I want to go back to that other question\nfirst and say one more thing. This ‘Don’t be evil’ mantra, it’s bullshit.”\nJobs felt personally betrayed. Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt had been on the Apple\nboard during the development of the iPhone and iPad, and Google’s founders, Larry\nPage  and  Sergey  Brin,  had  treated  him  as  a  mentor.  He  felt  ripped  off.  Android’s\ntouchscreen  interface  was  adopting  more  and  more  of  the  features—multi-touch,\nswiping, a grid of app icons—that Apple had created.\nJobs  had  tried  to  dissuade  Google  from  developing  Android.  He  had  gone  to\nGoogle’s headquarters near Palo Alto in 2008 and gotten into a shouting match with\nPage, Brin, and the head of the Android development team, Andy Rubin. (Because\nSchmidt was then on the Apple board, he recused himself from discussions involving\nthe iPhone.) “I said we would, if we had good relations, guarantee Google access to the\niPhone and guarantee it one or two icons on the home screen,” he recalled. But he also\nthreatened that if Google continued to develop Android and used any iPhone features,\nsuch as multi-touch, he would sue. At first Google avoided copying certain features, but\n\nin January 2010 HTC introduced an Android phone that boasted multi-touch and many\nother  aspects  of  the  iPhone’s  look  and  feel.  That  was  the  context  for  Jobs’s\npronouncement that Google’s “Don’t be evil” slogan was “bullshit.”\nSo Apple filed suit against HTC (and, by extension, Android), alleging infringement\nof  twenty  of  its  patents.  Among  them  were  patents  covering  various  multi-touch\ngestures, swipe to open, double-tap to zoom, pinch and expand, and the sensors that\ndetermined how a device was being held. As he sat in his house in Palo Alto the week\nthe lawsuit was filed, he became angrier than I had ever seen him:\nOur lawsuit is saying, “Google, you fucking ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us\noff.” Grand theft. I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every\npenny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I’m going to destroy\nAndroid, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.\nThey  are  scared  to  death,  because  they  know  they  are  guilty.  Outside  of  Search,\nGoogle’s products—Android, Google Docs—are shit.\nA few days after this rant, Jobs got a call from Schmidt, who had resigned from the\nApple board the previous summer. He suggested they get together for coffee, and they\nmet at a café in a Palo Alto shopping center. “We spent half the time talking about\npersonal matters, then half the time on his perception that Google had stolen Apple’s\nuser interface designs,” recalled Schmidt. When it came to the latter subject, Jobs did\nmost of the talking. Google had ripped him off, he said in colorful language. “We’ve got\nyou red-handed,” he told Schmidt. “I’m not interested in settling. I don’t want your\nmoney. If you offer me $5 billion, I won’t want it. I’ve got plenty of money. I want you\nto stop using our ideas in Android, that’s all I want.” They resolved nothing.\nUnderlying the dispute was an even more fundamental issue, one that had unnerving\nhistorical resonance. Google presented Android as an “open” platform; its open-source\ncode was freely available for multiple hardware makers to use on whatever phones or\ntablets they built. Jobs, of course, had a dogmatic belief that Apple should closely\nintegrate its operating systems with its hardware. In the 1980s Apple had not licensed\nout its Macintosh operating system, and Microsoft eventually gained dominant market\nshare by licensing its system to multiple hardware makers and, in Jobs’s mind, ripping\noff Apple’s interface.\nThe comparison between what Microsoft wrought in the 1980s and what Google\nwas trying to do in 2010 was not exact, but it was close enough to be unsettling—and\ninfuriating. It exemplified the great debate of the digital age: closed versus open, or as\nJobs framed it, integrated versus fragmented. Was it better, as Apple believed and as\nJobs’s  own  controlling  perfectionism  almost  compelled,  to  tie  the  hardware  and\nsoftware  and  content  handling  into  one  tidy  system  that  assured  a  simple  user\n\nexperience? Or was it better to give users and manufacturers more choice and free up\navenues for more innovation, by creating software systems that could be modified and\nused on different devices? “Steve has a particular way that he wants to run Apple, and\nit’s the same as it was twenty years ago, which is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of\nclosed systems,” Schmidt later told me. “They don’t want people to be on their platform\nwithout permission. The benefits of a closed platform is control. But Google has a\nspecific belief that open is the better approach, because it leads to more options and\ncompetition and consumer choice.”\nSo what did Bill Gates think as he watched Jobs, with his closed strategy, go into\nbattle  against  Google,  as  he  had  done  against  Microsoft  twenty-five  years  earlier?\n“There are some benefits to being more closed, in terms of how much you control the\nexperience, and certainly at times he’s had the benefit of that,” Gates told me. But\nrefusing to license the Apple iOS, he added, gave competitors like Android the chance\nto gain greater volume. In addition, he argued, competition among a variety of devices\nand  manufacturers  leads  to  greater  consumer  choice  and  more  innovation.  “These\ncompanies are not all building pyramids next to Central Park,” he said, poking fun at\nApple’s  Fifth  Avenue  store,  “but  they  are  coming  up  with  innovations  based  on\ncompeting for consumers.” Most of the improvements in PCs, Gates pointed out, came\nbecause consumers had a lot of choices, and that would someday be the case in the\nworld of mobile devices. “Eventually, I think, open will succeed, but that’s where I\ncome from. In the long run, the coherence thing, you can’t stay with that.”\nJobs believed  in  “the  coherence  thing.”  His  faith  in  a  controlled  and  closed\nenvironment remained unwavering, even as Android gained market share. “Google says\nwe exert more control than they do, that we are closed and they are open,” he railed\nwhen I told him what Schmidt had said. “Well, look at the results—Android’s a mess. It\nhas different screen sizes and versions, over a hundred permutations.” Even if Google’s\napproach might eventually win in the marketplace, Jobs found it repellent. “I like being\nresponsible for the whole user experience. We do it not to make money. We do it\nbecause we want to make great products, not crap like Android.”\nFlash, the App Store, and Control\nJobs’s insistence on end-to-end control was manifested in other battles as well. At the\ntown hall meeting where he attacked Google, he also assailed Adobe’s multimedia\nplatform for websites, Flash, as a “buggy” battery hog made by “lazy” people. The iPod\nand  iPhone,  he  said,  would  never  run  Flash.  “Flash  is  a  spaghetti-ball  piece  of\ntechnology that has lousy performance and really bad security problems,” he said to me\nlater that week.\n\nHe even banned apps that made use of a compiler created by Adobe that translated\nFlash code so that it would be compatible with Apple’s iOS. Jobs disdained the use of\ncompilers that allowed developers to write their products once and have them ported to\nmultiple operating systems. “Allowing Flash to be ported across platforms means things\nget dumbed down to the lowest common denominator,” he said. “We spend lots of effort\nto make our platform better, and the developer doesn’t get any benefit if Adobe only\nworks with functions that every platform has. So we said that we want developers to\ntake advantage of our better features, so that their apps work better on our platform than\nthey work on anybody else’s.” On that he was right. Losing the ability to differentiate\nApple’s platforms—allowing them to become commoditized like HP and Dell machines\n—would have meant death for the company.\nThere was, in addition, a more personal reason. Apple had invested in Adobe in\n1985, and together the two companies had launched the desktop publishing revolution.\n“I helped put Adobe on the map,” Jobs claimed. In 1999, after he returned to Apple, he\nhad asked Adobe to start making its video editing software and other products for the\niMac  and  its  new  operating  system,  but  Adobe  refused.  It  focused  on  making  its\nproducts for Windows. Soon after, its founder, John Warnock, retired. “The soul of\nAdobe disappeared when Warnock left,” Jobs said. “He was the inventor, the person I\nrelated to. It’s been a bunch of suits since then, and the company has turned out crap.”\nWhen Adobe evangelists and various Flash supporters in the blogosphere attacked\nJobs  for  being  too  controlling,  he  decided  to  write  and  post  an  open  letter.  Bill\nCampbell, his friend and board member, came by his house to go over it. “Does it sound\nlike I’m just trying to stick it to Adobe?” he asked Campbell. “No, it’s facts, just put it\nout there,” the coach said. Most of the letter focused on the technical drawbacks of\nFlash. But despite Campbell’s coaching, Jobs couldn’t resist venting at the end about the\nproblematic history between the two companies. “Adobe was the last major third party\ndeveloper to fully adopt Mac OS X,” he noted.\nApple ended up lifting some of its restrictions on cross-platform compilers later in\nthe  year,  and  Adobe  was  able  to  come  out  with  a  Flash  authoring  tool  that  took\nadvantage of the key features of Apple’s iOS. It was a bitter war, but one in which Jobs\nhad the better argument. In the end it pushed Adobe and other developers of compilers\nto make better use of the iPhone and iPad interface and its special features.\nJobs had a tougher time navigating the controversies over Apple’s desire to keep tight\ncontrol over which apps could be downloaded onto the iPhone and iPad. Guarding\nagainst  apps  that  contained  viruses  or  violated  the  user’s  privacy  made  sense;\npreventing apps that took users to other websites to buy subscriptions, rather than doing\nit through the iTunes Store, at least had a business rationale. But Jobs and his team went\nfurther:  They  decided  to  ban  any  app  that  defamed  people,  might  be  politically\nexplosive, or was deemed by Apple’s censors to be pornographic.\n\nThe  problem  of  playing  nanny  became  apparent  when  Apple  rejected  an  app\nfeaturing the animated political cartoons of Mark Fiore, on the rationale that his attacks\non  the  Bush  administration’s  policy  on  torture  violated  the  restriction  against\ndefamation. Its decision became public, and was subjected to ridicule, when Fiore won\nthe 2010 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in April. Apple had to reverse itself,\nand Jobs made a public apology. “We’re guilty of making mistakes,” he said. “We’re\ndoing the best we can, we’re learning as fast as we can—but we thought this rule made\nsense.”\nIt was more than a mistake. It raised the specter of Apple’s controlling what apps we\ngot to see and read, at least if we wanted to use an iPad or iPhone. Jobs seemed in\ndanger of becoming the Orwellian Big Brother he had gleefully destroyed in Apple’s\n“1984” Macintosh ad. He took the issue seriously. One day he called the New York\nTimes columnist Tom Friedman to discuss how to draw lines without looking like a\ncensor. He asked Friedman to head an advisory group to help come up with guidelines,\nbut  the  columnist’s  publisher  said  it  would  be  a  conflict  of  interest,  and  no  such\ncommittee was formed.\nThe  pornography  ban  also  caused  problems.  “We  believe  we  have  a  moral\nresponsibility to keep porn off the iPhone,” Jobs declared in an email to a customer.\n“Folks who want porn can buy an Android.”\nThis prompted an email exchange with Ryan Tate, the editor of the tech gossip site\nValleywag.  Sipping  a  stinger  cocktail  one  evening,  Tate  shot  off  an  email  to  Jobs\ndecrying Apple’s heavy-handed control over which apps passed muster. “If Dylan was\n20 today, how would he feel about your company?” Tate asked. “Would he think the\niPad had the faintest thing to do with ‘revolution’? Revolutions are about freedom.”\nTo Tate’s surprise, Jobs responded a few hours later, after midnight. “Yep,” he said,\n“freedom from programs that steal your private data. Freedom from programs that trash\nyour battery. Freedom from porn. Yep, freedom. The times they are a changin’, and\nsome traditional PC folks feel like their world is slipping away. It is.”\nIn his reply, Tate offered some thoughts on Flash and other topics, then returned to\nthe censorship issue. “And you know what? I don’t want ‘freedom from porn.’ Porn is\njust fine! And I think my wife would agree.”\n“You might care more about porn when you have kids,” replied Jobs. “It’s not about\nfreedom, it’s about Apple trying to do the right thing for its users.” At the end he added\na zinger: “By the way, what have you done that’s so great? Do you create anything, or\njust criticize others’ work and belittle their motivations?”\nTate admitted to being impressed. “Rare is the CEO who will spar one-on-one with\ncustomers and bloggers like this,” he wrote. “Jobs deserves big credit for breaking the\nmold of the typical American executive, and not just because his company makes such\nhugely superior products: Jobs not only built and then rebuilt his company around some\nvery  strong  opinions  about  digital  life,  but  he’s  willing  to  defend  them  in  public.\nVigorously. Bluntly. At two in the morning on a weekend.” Many in the blogosphere\n\nagreed, and they sent Jobs emails praising his feistiness. Jobs was proud as well; he\nforwarded his exchange with Tate and some of the kudos to me.\nStill, there was something unnerving about Apple’s decreeing that those who bought\ntheir products shouldn’t look at controversial political cartoons or, for that matter, porn.\nThe humor site eSarcasm.com launched a “Yes, Steve, I want porn” web campaign. “We\nare dirty, sex-obsessed miscreants who need access to smut 24 hours a day,” the site\ndeclared. “Either that, or we just enjoy the idea of an uncensored, open society where a\ntechno-dictator doesn’t decide what we can and cannot see.”\nAt  the  time  Jobs  and  Apple  were  engaged  in  a  battle  with  Valleywag’s  affiliated\nwebsite, Gizmodo, which had gotten hold of a test version of the unreleased iPhone 4\nthat a hapless Apple engineer had left in a bar. When the police, responding to Apple’s\ncomplaint, raided the house of the reporter, it raised the question of whether control\nfreakiness had combined with arrogance.\nJon Stewart was a friend of Jobs and an Apple fan. Jobs had visited him privately in\nFebruary when he took his trip to New York to meet with media executives. But that\ndidn’t stop Stewart from going after him on The Daily Show. “It wasn’t supposed to be\nthis way! Microsoft was supposed to be the evil one!” Stewart said, only half-jokingly.\nBehind him, the word “appholes” appeared on the screen. “You guys were the rebels,\nman, the underdogs. But now, are you becoming The Man? Remember back in 1984, you\nhad those awesome ads about overthrowing Big Brother? Look in the mirror, man!”\nBy late spring the issue was being discussed among board members. “There is an\narrogance,” Art Levinson told me over lunch just after he had raised it at a meeting. “It\nties into Steve’s personality. He can react viscerally and lay out his convictions in a\nforceful manner.” Such arrogance was fine when Apple was the feisty underdog. But\nnow Apple was dominant in the mobile market. “We need to make the transition to being\na big company and dealing with the hubris issue,” said Levinson. Al Gore also talked\nabout the problem at board meetings. “The context for Apple is changing dramatically,”\nhe recounted. “It’s not hammer-thrower against Big Brother. Now Apple’s big, and\npeople see it as arrogant.” Jobs became defensive when the topic was raised. “He’s\nstill adjusting to it,” said Gore. “He’s better at being the underdog than being a humble\ngiant.”\nJobs had little patience for such talk. The reason Apple was being criticized, he told\nme then, was that “companies like Google and Adobe are lying about us and trying to\ntear  us  down.”  What  did  he  think  of  the  suggestion  that  Apple  sometimes  acted\narrogantly? “I’m not worried about that,” he said, “because we’re not arrogant.”\nAntennagate: Design versus Engineering\n\nIn many consumer product companies, there’s tension between the designers, who want\nto make a product look beautiful, and the engineers, who need to make sure it fulfills its\nfunctional requirements. At Apple, where Jobs pushed both design and engineering to\nthe edge, that tension was even greater.\nWhen he and design director Jony Ive became creative coconspirators back in 1997,\nthey  tended  to  view  the  qualms  expressed  by  engineers  as  evidence  of  a  can’t-do\nattitude  that  needed  to  be  overcome.  Their  faith  that  awesome  design  could  force\nsuperhuman feats of engineering was reinforced by the success of the iMac and iPod.\nWhen engineers said something couldn’t be done, Ive and Jobs pushed them to try, and\nusually they succeeded. There were occasional small problems. The iPod Nano, for\nexample,  was  prone  to  getting  scratched  because  Ive  believed  that  a  clear  coating\nwould lessen the purity of his design. But that was not a crisis.\nWhen  it  came  to  designing  the  iPhone,  Ive’s  design  desires  bumped  into  a\nfundamental law of physics that could not be changed even by a reality distortion field.\nMetal is not a great material to put near an antenna. As Michael Faraday showed,\nelectromagnetic waves flow around the surface of metal, not through it. So a metal\nenclosure around a phone can create what is known as a Faraday cage, diminishing the\nsignals that get in or out. The original iPhone started with a plastic band at the bottom,\nbut  Ive  thought  that  would  wreck  the  design  integrity  and  asked  that  there  be  an\naluminum rim all around. After that ended up working out, Ive designed the iPhone 4\nwith a steel rim. The steel would be the structural support, look really sleek, and serve\nas part of the phone’s antenna.\nThere were significant challenges. In order to serve as an antenna, the steel rim had\nto have a tiny gap. But if a person covered that gap with a finger or sweaty palm, there\ncould be some signal loss. The engineers suggested a clear coating over the metal to\nhelp prevent this, but again Ive felt that this would detract from the brushed-metal look.\nThe issue was presented to Jobs at various meetings, but he thought the engineers were\ncrying wolf. You can make this work, he said. And so they did.\nAnd it worked, almost perfectly. But not totally perfectly. When the iPhone 4 was\nreleased in June 2010, it looked awesome, but a problem soon became evident: If you\nheld the phone a certain way, especially using your left hand so your palm covered the\ntiny gap, you could lose your connection. It occurred with perhaps one in a hundred\ncalls. Because Jobs insisted on keeping his unreleased products secret (even the phone\nthat Gizmodo scored in a bar had a fake case around it), the iPhone 4 did not go through\nthe live testing that most electronic devices get. So the flaw was not caught before the\nmassive rush to buy it began. “The question is whether the twin policies of putting\ndesign  in  front  of  engineering  and  having  a  policy  of  supersecrecy  surrounding\nunreleased products helped Apple,” Tony Fadell said later. “On the whole, yes, but\nunchecked power is a bad thing, and that’s what happened.”\nHad it not been the Apple iPhone 4, a product that had everyone transfixed, the issue\nof a few extra dropped calls would not have made news. But it became known as\n\n“Antennagate,” and it boiled to a head in early July, when Consumer Reports did some\nrigorous tests and said that it could not recommend the iPhone 4 because of the antenna\nproblem.\nJobs was in Kona Village, Hawaii, with his family when the issue arose. At first he\nwas defensive. Art Levinson was in constant contact by phone, and Jobs insisted that the\nproblem stemmed from Google and Motorola making mischief. “They want to shoot\nApple down,” he said.\nLevinson urged a little humility. “Let’s try to figure out if there’s something wrong,”\nhe said. When he again mentioned the perception that Apple was arrogant, Jobs didn’t\nlike it. It went against his black-white, right-wrong way of viewing the world. Apple\nwas a company of principle, he felt. If others failed to see that, it was their fault, not a\nreason for Apple to play humble.\nJobs’s second reaction was to be hurt. He took the criticism personally and became\nemotionally anguished. “At his core, he doesn’t do things that he thinks are blatantly\nwrong, like some pure pragmatists in our business,” Levinson said. “So if he feels he’s\nright, he will just charge ahead rather than question himself.” Levinson urged him not to\nget depressed. But Jobs did. “Fuck this, it’s not worth it,” he told Levinson. Finally Tim\nCook was able to shake him out of his lethargy. He quoted someone as saying that Apple\nwas becoming the new Microsoft, complacent and arrogant. The next day Jobs changed\nhis attitude. “Let’s get to the bottom of this,” he said.\nWhen the data about dropped calls were assembled from AT&T, Jobs realized there\nwas a problem, even if it was more minor than people were making it seem. So he flew\nback from Hawaii. But before he left, he made some phone calls. It was time to gather a\ncouple of trusted old hands, wise men who had been with him during the original\nMacintosh days thirty years earlier.\nHis first call was to Regis McKenna, the public relations guru. “I’m coming back\nfrom Hawaii to deal with this antenna thing, and I need to bounce some stuff off of you,”\nJobs  told  him.  They  agreed  to  meet  at  the  Cupertino  boardroom  at  1:30  the  next\nafternoon. The second call was to the adman Lee Clow. He had tried to retire from the\nApple account, but Jobs liked having him around. His colleague James Vincent was\nsummoned as well.\nJobs also decided to bring his son Reed, then a high school senior, back with him\nfrom Hawaii. “I’m going to be in meetings 24/7 for probably two days and I want you to\nbe in every single one because you’ll learn more in those two days than you would in\ntwo years at business school,” he told him. “You’re going to be in the room with the\nbest people in the world making really tough decisions and get to see how the sausage is\nmade.”  Jobs  got  a  little  misty-eyed  when  he  recalled  the  experience.  “I  would  go\nthrough that all again just for that opportunity to have him see me at work,” he said. “He\ngot to see what his dad does.”\nThey were joined by Katie Cotton, the steady public relations chief at Apple, and\nseven other top executives. The meeting lasted all afternoon. “It was one of the greatest\n\nmeetings of my life,” Jobs later said. He began by laying out all the data they had\ngathered. “Here are the facts. So what should we do about it?”\nMcKenna was the most calm and straightforward. “Just lay out the truth, the data,” he\nsaid. “Don’t appear arrogant, but appear firm and confident.” Others, including Vincent,\npushed Jobs to be more apologetic, but McKenna said no. “Don’t go into the press\nconference with your tail between your legs,” he advised. “You should just say: ‘Phones\naren’t perfect, and we’re not perfect. We’re human and doing the best we can, and\nhere’s the data.’” That became the strategy. When the topic turned to the perception of\narrogance, McKenna urged him not to worry too much. “I don’t think it would work to\ntry  to  make  Steve  look  humble,”  McKenna  explained  later.  “As  Steve  says  about\nhimself, ‘What you see is what you get.’”\nAt  the  press  event  that  Friday,  held  in  Apple’s  auditorium,  Jobs  followed\nMcKenna’s advice. He did not grovel or apologize, yet he was able to defuse the\nproblem by showing that Apple understood it and would try to make it right. Then he\nchanged  the  framework  of  the  discussion,  saying  that  all  cell  phones  had  some\nproblems. Later he told me that he had sounded a bit “too annoyed” at the event, but in\nfact he was able to strike a tone that was unemotional and straightforward. He captured\nit in four short, declarative sentences: “We’re not perfect. Phones are not perfect. We all\nknow that. But we want to make our users happy.”\nIf anyone was unhappy, he said, they could return the phone (the return rate turned\nout to be 1.7%, less than a third of the return rate for the iPhone 3GS or most other\nphones) or get a free bumper case from Apple. He went on to report data showing that\nother mobile phones had similar problems. That was not totally true. Apple’s antenna\ndesign made it slightly worse than most other phones, including earlier versions of the\niPhone. But it was true that the media frenzy over the iPhone 4’s dropped calls was\noverblown. “This is blown so out of proportion that it’s incredible,” he said. Instead of\nbeing appalled that he didn’t grovel or order a recall, most customers realized that he\nwas right.\nThe wait list for the phone, which was already sold out, went from two weeks to\nthree. It remained the company’s fastest-selling product ever. The media debate shifted\nto the issue of whether Jobs was right to assert that other smartphones had the same\nantenna problems. Even if the answer was no, that was a better story to face than one\nabout whether the iPhone 4 was a defective dud.\nSome media  observers  were  incredulous.  “In  a  bravura  demonstration  of\nstonewalling, righteousness, and hurt sincerity, Steve Jobs successfully took to the stage\nthe other day to deny the problem, dismiss the criticism, and spread the blame among\nother smartphone makers,” Michael Wolff of newser.com wrote. “This is a level of\nmodern marketing, corporate spin, and crisis management about which you can only ask\nwith stupefied incredulity and awe: How do they get away with it? Or, more accurately,\nhow does he get away with it?” Wolff attributed it to Jobs’s mesmerizing effect as “the\nlast  charismatic  individual.”  Other  CEOs  would  be  offering  abject  apologies  and\n\nswallowing massive recalls, but Jobs didn’t have to. “The grim, skeletal appearance,\nthe absolutism, the ecclesiastical bearing, the sense of his relationship with the sacred,\nreally works, and, in this instance, allows him the privilege of magisterially deciding\nwhat is meaningful and what is trivial.”\nScott Adams, the creator of the cartoon strip Dilbert, was also incredulous, but far\nmore admiring. He wrote a blog entry a few days later (which Jobs proudly emailed\naround)  that  marveled  at  how  Jobs’s  “high  ground  maneuver”  was  destined  to  be\nstudied as a new public relations standard. “Apple’s response to the iPhone 4 problem\ndidn’t  follow  the  public  relations  playbook,  because  Jobs  decided  to  rewrite  the\nplaybook,” Adams wrote. “If you want to know what genius looks like, study Jobs’\nwords.” By proclaiming up front that phones are not perfect, Jobs changed the context of\nthe argument with an indisputable assertion. “If Jobs had not changed the context from\nthe iPhone 4 to all smartphones in general, I could make you a hilarious comic strip\nabout a product so poorly made that it won’t work if it comes in contact with a human\nhand. But as soon as the context is changed to ‘all smartphones have problems,’ the\nhumor opportunity is gone. Nothing kills humor like a general and boring truth.”\nHere Comes the Sun\nThere were a few things that needed to be resolved for the career of Steve Jobs to be\ncomplete. Among them was an end to the Thirty Years’ War with the band he loved, the\nBeatles. In 2007 Apple had settled its trademark battle with Apple Corps, the holding\ncompany of the Beatles, which had first sued the fledgling computer company over use\nof the name in 1978. But that still did not get the Beatles into the iTunes Store. The band\nwas the last major holdout, primarily because it had not resolved with EMI music,\nwhich owned most of its songs, how to handle the digital rights.\nBy the summer of 2010 the Beatles and EMI had sorted things out, and a four-person\nsummit was held in the boardroom in Cupertino. Jobs and his vice president for the\niTunes Store, Eddy Cue, played host to Jeff Jones, who managed the Beatles’ interests,\nand Roger Faxon, the chief of EMI music. Now that the Beatles were ready to go\ndigital,  what  could  Apple  offer  to  make  that  milestone  special?  Jobs  had  been\nanticipating this day for a long time. In fact he and his advertising team, Lee Clow and\nJames Vincent, had mocked up some ads and commercials three years earlier when\nstrategizing on how to lure the Beatles on board.\n“Steve and I thought about all the things that we could possibly do,” Cue recalled.\nThat included taking over the front page of the iTunes Store, buying billboards featuring\nthe best photographs of the band, and running a series of television ads in classic Apple\nstyle. The topper was offering a $149 box set that included all thirteen Beatles studio\n\nalbums, the two-volume “Past Masters” collection, and a nostalgia-inducing video of\nthe 1964 Washington Coliseum concert.\nOnce they reached an agreement in principle, Jobs personally helped choose the\nphotographs for the ads. Each commercial ended with a still black-and-white shot of\nPaul McCartney and John Lennon, young and smiling, in a recording studio looking\ndown at a piece of music. It evoked the old photographs of Jobs and Wozniak looking at\nan Apple circuit board. “Getting the Beatles on iTunes was the culmination of why we\ngot into the music business,” said Cue.\n\nCHAPTER FORTY\nTO INFINITY\nThe Cloud, the Spaceship, and Beyond\nThe iPad 2\nEven before the iPad went on sale, Jobs was thinking about what should be in the iPad\n2.  It  needed  front  and  back  cameras—everyone  knew  that  was  coming—and  he\ndefinitely wanted it to be thinner. But there was a peripheral issue that he focused on\nthat most people hadn’t thought about: The cases that people used covered the beautiful\nlines of the iPad and detracted from the screen. They made fatter what should be thinner.\nThey put a pedestrian cloak on a device that should be magical in all of its aspects.\nAround that time he read an article about magnets, cut it out, and handed it to Jony\nIve. The magnets had a cone of attraction that could be precisely focused. Perhaps they\ncould be used to align a detachable cover. That way, it could snap onto the front of an\niPad but not have to engulf the entire device. One of the guys in Ive’s group worked out\nhow to make a detachable cover that could connect with a magnetic hinge. When you\nbegan to open it, the screen would pop to life like the face of a tickled baby, and then\nthe cover could fold into a stand.\nIt was not high-tech; it was purely mechanical. But it was enchanting. It also was\nanother example of Jobs’s desire for end-to-end integration: The cover and the iPad had\nbeen designed together so that the magnets and hinge all connected seamlessly. The iPad\n2 would have many improvements, but this cheeky little cover, which most other CEOs\nwould never have bothered with, was the one that would elicit the most smiles.\nBecause Jobs was on another medical leave, he was not expected to be at the launch\nof the iPad 2, scheduled for March 2, 2011, in San Francisco. But when the invitations\nwere sent out, he told me that I should try to be there. It was the usual scene: top Apple\nexecutives in the front row, Tim Cook eating energy bars, and the sound system blaring\n\nthe appropriate Beatles songs, building up to “Revolution” and “Here Comes the Sun.”\nReed Jobs arrived at the last minute with two rather wide-eyed freshman dorm mates.\n“We’ve been working on this product for a while, and I just didn’t want to miss\ntoday,” Jobs said as he ambled onstage looking scarily gaunt but with a jaunty smile.\nThe crowd erupted in whoops, hollers, and a standing ovation.\nHe began his demo of the iPad 2 by showing off the new cover. “This time, the case\nand the product were designed together,” he explained. Then he moved on to address a\ncriticism that had been rankling him because it had some merit: The original iPad had\nbeen better at consuming content than at creating it. So Apple had adapted its two best\ncreative applications for the Macintosh, GarageBand and iMovie, and made powerful\nversions  available  for  the  iPad.  Jobs  showed  how  easy  it  was  to  compose  and\norchestrate a song, or put music and special effects into your home videos, and post or\nshare such creations using the new iPad.\nOnce again he ended his presentation with the slide showing the intersection of\nLiberal Arts Street and Technology Street. And this time he gave one of the clearest\nexpressions of his credo, that true creativity and simplicity come from integrating the\nwhole widget—hardware and software, and for that matter content and covers and\nsalesclerks—rather than allowing things to be open and fragmented, as happened in the\nworld of Windows PCs and was now happening with Android devices:\nIt’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. We believe that it’s technology\nmarried with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our heart sing. Nowhere\nis that more true than in these post-PC devices. Folks are rushing into this tablet market,\nand they’re looking at it as the next PC, in which the hardware and the software are\ndone by different companies. Our experience, and every bone in our body, says that is\nnot the right approach. These are post-PC devices that need to be even more intuitive\nand  easier  to  use  than  a  PC,  and  where  the  software  and  the  hardware  and  the\napplications need to be intertwined in an even more seamless way than they are on a\nPC. We think we have the right architecture not just in silicon, but in our organization, to\nbuild these kinds of products.\nIt was an architecture that was bred not just into the organization he had built, but into\nhis own soul.\nAfter the launch event, Jobs was energized. He came to the Four Seasons hotel to join\nme, his wife, and Reed, plus Reed’s two Stanford pals, for lunch. For a change he was\neating, though still with some pickiness. He ordered fresh-squeezed juice, which he sent\nback  three  times,  declaring  that  each  new  offering  was  from  a  bottle,  and  a  pasta\n\nprimavera, which he shoved away as inedible after one taste. But then he ate half of my\ncrab Louie salad and ordered a full one for himself, followed by a bowl of ice cream.\nThe indulgent hotel was even able to produce a glass of juice that finally met his\nstandards.\nAt his house the following day he was still on a high. He was planning to fly to Kona\nVillage the next day, alone, and I asked to see what he had put on his iPad 2 for the trip.\nThere were three movies: Chinatown, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Toy Story 3. More\nrevealingly, there was just one book that he had downloaded: The Autobiography of a\nYogi, the guide to meditation and spirituality that he had first read as a teenager, then\nreread in India, and had read once a year ever since.\nMidway through the morning he decided he wanted to eat something. He was still\ntoo weak to drive, so I drove him to a café in a shopping mall. It was closed, but the\nowner was used to Jobs knocking on the door at off-hours, and he happily let us in.\n“He’s taken on a mission to try to fatten me up,” Jobs joked. His doctors had pushed him\nto eat eggs as a source of high-quality protein, and he ordered an omelet. “Living with a\ndisease like this, and all the pain, constantly reminds you of your own mortality, and that\ncan do strange things to your brain if you’re not careful,” he said. “You don’t make\nplans more than a year out, and that’s bad. You need to force yourself to plan as if you\nwill live for many years.”\nAn example of this magical thinking was his plan to build a luxurious yacht. Before\nhis liver transplant, he and his family used to rent a boat for vacations, traveling to\nMexico, the South Pacific, or the Mediterranean. On many of these cruises, Jobs got\nbored or began to hate the design of the boat, so they would cut the trip short and fly to\nKona Village. But sometimes the cruise worked well. “The best vacation I’ve ever been\non was when we went down the coast of Italy, then to Athens—which is a pit, but the\nParthenon is mind-blowing—and then to Ephesus in Turkey, where they have these\nancient  public  lavatories  in  marble  with  a  place  in  the  middle  for  musicians  to\nserenade.” When they got to Istanbul, he hired a history professor to give his family a\ntour. At the end they went to a Turkish bath, where the professor’s lecture gave Jobs an\ninsight about the globalization of youth:\nI had a real revelation. We were all in robes, and they made some Turkish coffee for us.\nThe professor explained how the coffee was made very different from anywhere else,\nand I realized, “So fucking what?” Which kids even in Turkey give a shit about Turkish\ncoffee? All day I had looked at young people in Istanbul. They were all drinking what\nevery other kid in the world drinks, and they were wearing clothes that look like they\nwere  bought  at  the  Gap,  and  they  are  all  using  cell  phones.  They  were  like  kids\neverywhere else. It hit me that, for young people, this whole world is the same now.\nWhen we’re making products, there is no such thing as a Turkish phone, or a music\n\nplayer that young people in Turkey would want that’s different from one young people\nelsewhere would want. We’re just one world now.\nAfter the joy of that cruise, Jobs had amused himself by beginning to design, and then\nrepeatedly redesigning, a boat he said he wanted to build someday. When he got sick\nagain in 2009, he almost canceled the project. “I didn’t think I would be alive when it\ngot done,” he recalled. “But that made me so sad, and I decided that working on the\ndesign was fun to do, and maybe I have a shot at being alive when it’s done. If I stop\nwork on the boat and then I make it alive for another two years, I would be really\npissed. So I’ve kept going.”\nAfter our omelets at the café, we went back to his house and he showed me all of the\nmodels  and  architectural  drawings.  As  expected,  the  planned  yacht  was  sleek  and\nminimalist. The teak decks were perfectly flat and unblemished by any accoutrements.\nAs at an Apple store, the cabin windows were large panes, almost floor to ceiling, and\nthe main living area was designed to have walls of glass that were forty feet long and\nten feet high. He had gotten the chief engineer of the Apple stores to design a special\nglass that was able to provide structural support.\nBy then  the  boat  was  under  construction  by  the  Dutch  custom  yacht  builders\nFeadship, but Jobs was still fiddling with the design. “I know that it’s possible I will\ndie and leave Laurene with a half-built boat,” he said. “But I have to keep going on it. If\nI don’t, it’s an admission that I’m about to die.”\nHe and Powell would be celebrating their twentieth wedding anniversary a few days\nlater,  and  he  admitted  that  at  times  he  had  not  been  as  appreciative  of  her  as  she\ndeserved. “I’m very lucky, because you just don’t know what you’re getting into when\nyou get married,” he said. “You have an intuitive feeling about things. I couldn’t have\ndone better, because not only is Laurene smart and beautiful, she’s turned out to be a\nreally good person.” For a moment he teared up. He talked about his other girlfriends,\nparticularly Tina Redse, but said he ended up in the right place. He also reflected on\nhow selfish and demanding he could be. “Laurene had to deal with that, and also with\nme being sick,” he said. “I know that living with me is not a bowl of cherries.”\nAmong  his  selfish  traits  was  that  he  tended  not  to  remember  anniversaries  or\nbirthdays. But in this case, he decided to plan a surprise. They had gotten married at the\nAhwahnee  Hotel  in  Yosemite,  and  he  decided  to  take  Powell  back  there  on  their\nanniversary. But when Jobs called, the place was fully booked. So he had the hotel\napproach the people who had reserved the suite where he and Powell had stayed and\nask if they would relinquish it. “I offered to pay for another weekend,” Jobs recalled,\n“and the man was very nice and said, ‘Twenty years, please take it, it’s yours.’”\n\nHe found the photographs of the wedding, taken by a friend, and had large prints\nmade on thick paper boards and placed in an elegant box. Scrolling through his iPhone,\nhe found the note that he had composed to be included in the box and read it aloud:\nWe didn’t know much about each other twenty years ago. We were guided by our\nintuition;  you  swept  me  off  my  feet.  It  was  snowing  when  we  got  married  at  the\nAhwahnee. Years passed, kids came, good times, hard times, but never bad times. Our\nlove and respect has endured and grown. We’ve been through so much together and here\nwe are right back where we started 20 years ago—older, wiser—with wrinkles on our\nfaces and hearts. We now know many of life’s joys, sufferings, secrets and wonders and\nwe’re still here together. My feet have never returned to the ground.\nBy  the end  of  the  recitation  he  was  crying  uncontrollably.  When  he  composed\nhimself, he noted that he had also made a set of the pictures for each of his kids. “I\nthought they might like to see that I was young once.”\niCloud\nIn 2001 Jobs had a vision: Your personal computer would serve as a “digital hub” for a\nvariety of lifestyle devices, such as music players, video recorders, phones, and tablets.\nThis played to Apple’s strength of creating end-to-end products that were simple to use.\nThe company was thus transformed from a high-end niche computer company to the\nmost valuable technology company in the world.\nBy 2008 Jobs had developed a vision for the next wave of the digital era. In the\nfuture, he believed, your desktop computer would no longer serve as the hub for your\ncontent. Instead the hub would move to “the cloud.” In other words, your content would\nbe  stored  on  remote  servers  managed  by  a  company  you  trusted,  and  it  would  be\navailable for you to use on any device, anywhere. It would take him three years to get it\nright.\nHe began with a false step. In the summer of 2008 he launched a product called\nMobileMe, an expensive ($99 per year) subscription service that allowed you to store\nyour address book, documents, pictures, videos, email, and calendar remotely in the\ncloud and to sync them with any device. In theory, you could go to your iPhone or any\ncomputer  and  access  all  aspects  of  your  digital  life.  There  was,  however,  a  big\nproblem:  The  service,  to  use  Jobs’s  terminology,  sucked.  It  was  complex,  devices\ndidn’t sync well, and email and other data got lost randomly in the ether. “Apple’s\n\nMobileMe Is Far Too Flawed to Be Reliable,” was the headline on Walt Mossberg’s\nreview in the Wall Street Journal.\nJobs was furious. He gathered the MobileMe team in the auditorium on the Apple\ncampus, stood onstage, and asked, “Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to\ndo?” After the team members offered their answers, Jobs shot back: “So why the fuck\ndoesn’t  it  do  that?”  Over  the  next  half  hour  he  continued  to  berate  them.  “You’ve\ntarnished Apple’s reputation,” he said. “You should hate each other for having let each\nother down. Mossberg, our friend, is no longer writing good things about us.” In front of\nthe whole audience, he got rid of the leader of the MobileMe team and replaced him\nwith  Eddy  Cue,  who  oversaw  all  Internet  content  at  Apple.  As Fortune’s  Adam\nLashinsky reported in a dissection of the Apple corporate culture, “Accountability is\nstrictly enforced.”\nBy 2010 it was clear that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others were aiming to be\nthe company that could best store all of your content and data in the cloud and sync it on\nyour various devices. So Jobs redoubled his efforts. As he explained it to me that fall:\nWe need to be the company that manages your relationship with the cloud—streams your\nmusic and videos from the cloud, stores your pictures and information, and maybe even\nyour  medical  data.  Apple  was  the  first  to  have  the  insight  about  your  computer\nbecoming a digital hub. So we wrote all of these apps—iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes—and\ntied in our devices, like the iPod and iPhone and iPad, and it’s worked brilliantly. But\nover the next few years, the hub is going to move from your computer into the cloud. So\nit’s the same digital hub strategy, but the hub’s in a different place. It means you will\nalways have access to your content and you won’t have to sync.\nIt’s important that we make this transformation, because of what Clayton Christensen\ncalls “the innovator’s dilemma,” where people who invent something are usually the\nlast ones to see past it, and we certainly don’t want to be left behind. I’m going to take\nMobileMe and make it free, and we’re going to make syncing content simple. We are\nbuilding a server farm in North Carolina. We can provide all the syncing you need, and\nthat way we can lock in the customer.\nJobs discussed this vision at his Monday morning meetings, and gradually it was\nrefined to a new strategy. “I sent emails to groups of people at 2 a.m. and batted things\naround,” he recalled. “We think about this a lot because it’s not a job, it’s our life.”\nAlthough  some  board  members,  including  Al  Gore,  questioned  the  idea  of  making\nMobileMe free, they supported it. It would be their strategy for attracting customers into\nApple’s orbit for the next decade.\nThe new service was named iCloud, and Jobs unveiled it in his keynote address to\nApple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2011. He was still on medical\n\nleave and, for some days in May, had been hospitalized with infections and pain. Some\nclose friends urged him not to make the presentation, which would involve lots of\npreparation and rehearsals. But the prospect of ushering in another tectonic shift in the\ndigital age seemed to energize him.\nWhen he came onstage at the San Francisco Convention Center, he was wearing a\nVONROSEN black cashmere sweater on top of his usual Issey Miyake black turtleneck,\nand he had thermal underwear beneath his blue jeans. But he looked more gaunt than\never. The crowd gave him a prolonged standing ovation—“That always helps, and I\nappreciate it,” he said—but within minutes Apple’s stock dropped more than $4, to\n$340. He was making a heroic effort, but he looked weak.\nHe  handed  the  stage  over  to  Phil  Schiller  and  Scott  Forstall  to  demo  the  new\noperating systems for Macs and mobile devices, then came back on to show off iCloud\nhimself. “About ten years ago, we had one of our most important insights,” he said.\n“The PC was going to become the hub for your digital life. Your videos, your photos,\nyour music. But it has broken down in the last few years. Why?” He riffed about how\nhard it was to get all of your content synced to each of your devices. If you have a song\nyou’ve downloaded on your iPad, a picture you’ve taken on your iPhone, and a video\nyou’ve  stored  on  your  computer,  you  can  end  up  feeling  like  an  old-fashioned\nswitchboard operator as you plug USB cables into and out of things to get the content\nshared. “Keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy,” he said to great laughter.\n“We have a solution. It’s our next big insight. We are going to demote the PC and the\nMac to be just a device, and we are going to move the digital hub into the cloud.”\nJobs was well aware that this “big insight” was in fact not really new. Indeed he\njoked about Apple’s previous attempt: “You may think, Why should I believe them?\nThey’re the ones who brought me MobileMe.” The audience laughed nervously. “Let me\njust say it wasn’t our finest hour.” But as he demonstrated iCloud, it was clear that it\nwould be better. Mail, contacts, and calendar entries synced instantly. So did apps,\nphotos, books, and documents. Most impressively, Jobs and Eddy Cue had made deals\nwith the music companies (unlike the folks at Google and Amazon). Apple would have\neighteen million songs on its cloud servers. If you had any of these on any of your\ndevices or computers—whether you had bought it legally or pirated it—Apple would\nlet you access a high-quality version of it on all of your devices without having to go\nthrough the time and effort to upload it to the cloud. “It all just works,” he said.\nThat simple concept—that everything would just work seamlessly—was, as always,\nApple’s competitive advantage. Microsoft had been advertising “Cloud Power” for\nmore than a year, and three years earlier its chief software architect, the legendary Ray\nOzzie, had issued a rallying cry to the company: “Our aspiration is that individuals will\nonly need to license their media once, and use any of their ... devices to access and\nenjoy their media.” But Ozzie had quit Microsoft at the end of 2010, and the company’s\ncloud computing push was never manifested in consumer devices. Amazon and Google\nboth offered cloud services in 2011, but neither company had the ability to integrate the\n\nhardware and software and content of a variety of devices. Apple controlled every link\nin the chain and designed them all to work together: the devices, computers, operating\nsystems, and application software, along with the sale and storage of the content.\nOf course, it worked seamlessly only if you were using an Apple device and stayed\nwithin  Apple’s  gated  garden.  That  produced  another  benefit  for  Apple:  customer\nstickiness. Once you began using iCloud, it would be difficult to switch to a Kindle or\nAndroid device. Your music and other content would not sync to them; in fact they might\nnot even work. It was the culmination of three decades spent eschewing open systems.\n“We thought about whether we should do a music client for Android,” Jobs told me over\nbreakfast the next morning. “We put iTunes on Windows in order to sell more iPods. But\nI don’t see an advantage of putting our music app on Android, except to make Android\nusers happy. And I don’t want to make Android users happy.”\nA New Campus\nWhen Jobs was thirteen, he had looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book, called him to\nscore a part he needed for a frequency counter he was trying to build, and ended up\ngetting a summer job at the instruments division of Hewlett-Packard. That same year HP\nbought some land in Cupertino to expand its calculator division. Wozniak went to work\nthere, and it was on this site that he designed the Apple I and Apple II during his\nmoonlighting hours.\nWhen HP decided in 2010 to abandon its Cupertino campus, which was just about a\nmile east of Apple’s One Infinite Loop headquarters, Jobs quietly arranged to buy it and\nthe adjoining property. He admired the way that Hewlett and Packard had built a lasting\ncompany, and he prided himself on having done the same at Apple. Now he wanted a\nshowcase headquarters, something that no West Coast technology company had. He\neventually accumulated 150 acres, much of which had been apricot orchards when he\nwas a boy, and threw himself into what would become a legacy project that combined\nhis passion for design with his passion for creating an enduring company. “I want to\nleave a signature campus that expresses the values of the company for generations,” he\nsaid.\nHe hired what he considered to be the best architectural firm in the world, that of Sir\nNorman  Foster,  which  had  done  smartly  engineered  buildings  such  as  the  restored\nReichstag in Berlin and 30 St. Mary Axe in London. Not surprisingly, Jobs got so\ninvolved  in  the  planning,  both  the  vision  and  the  details,  that  it  became  almost\nimpossible to settle on a final design. This was to be his lasting edifice, and he wanted\nto get it right. Foster’s firm assigned fifty architects to the team, and every three weeks\nthroughout 2010 they showed Jobs revised models and options. Over and over he would\n\ncome up with new concepts, sometimes entirely new shapes, and make them restart and\nprovide more alternatives.\nWhen he first showed me the models and plans in his living room, the building was\nshaped like a huge winding racetrack made of three joined semicircles around a large\ncentral courtyard. The walls were floor-to-ceiling glass, and the interior had rows of\noffice  pods  that  allowed  the  sunlight  to  stream  down  the  aisles.  “It  permits\nserendipitous and fluid meeting spaces,” he said, “and everybody gets to participate in\nthe sunlight.”\nThe next time he showed me the plans, a month later, we were in Apple’s large\nconference  room  across  from  his  office,  where  a  model  of  the  proposed  building\ncovered the table. He had made a major change. The pods would all be set back from\nthe windows so that long corridors would be bathed in sun. These would also serve as\nthe common spaces. There was a debate with some of the architects, who wanted to\nallow the windows to be opened. Jobs had never liked the idea of people being able to\nopen things. “That would just allow people to screw things up,” he declared. On that, as\non other details, he prevailed.\nWhen he got home that evening, Jobs showed off the drawings at dinner, and Reed\njoked that the aerial view reminded him of male genitalia. His father dismissed the\ncomment as reflecting the mind-set of a teenager. But the next day he mentioned the\ncomment to the architects. “Unfortunately, once I’ve told you that, you’re never going to\nbe able to erase that image from your mind,” he said. By the next time I visited, the\nshape had been changed to a simple circle.\nThe  new  design  meant  that  there  would  not  be  a  straight  piece  of  glass  in  the\nbuilding. All would be curved and seamlessly joined. Jobs had long been fascinated\nwith glass, and his experience demanding huge custom panes for Apple’s retail stores\nmade him confident that it would be possible to make massive curved pieces in quantity.\nThe planned center courtyard was eight hundred feet across (more than three typical city\nblocks, or almost the length of three football fields), and he showed it to me with\noverlays  indicating  how  it  could  surround  St.  Peter’s  Square  in  Rome.  One  of  his\nlingering memories was of the orchards that had once dominated the area, so he hired a\nsenior  arborist  from  Stanford  and  decreed  that  80%  of  the  property  would  be\nlandscaped in a natural manner, with six thousand trees. “I asked him to make sure to\ninclude  a  new  set  of  apricot  orchards,”  Jobs  recalled.  “You  used  to  see  them\neverywhere, even on the corners, and they’re part of the legacy of this valley.”\nBy June 2011 the plans for the four-story, three-million-square-foot building, which\nwould hold more than twelve thousand employees, were ready to unveil. He decided to\ndo so in a quiet and unpublicized appearance before the Cupertino City Council on the\nday after he had announced iCloud at the Worldwide Developers Conference.\nEven though he had little energy, he had a full schedule that day. Ron Johnson, who\nhad developed Apple’s stores and run them for more than a decade, had decided to\naccept an offer to be the CEO of J.C. Penney, and he came by Jobs’s house in the\n\nmorning to discuss his departure. Then Jobs and I went into Palo Alto to a small yogurt\nand oatmeal café called Fraiche, where he talked animatedly about possible future\nApple products. Later that day he was driven to Santa Clara for the quarterly meeting\nthat Apple had with top Intel executives, where they discussed the possibility of using\nIntel  chips  in  future  mobile  devices.  That  night  U2  was  playing  at  the  Oakland\nColiseum, and Jobs had considered going. Instead he decided to use that evening to\nshow his plans to the Cupertino Council.\nArriving without an entourage or any fanfare, and looking relaxed in the same black\nsweater he had worn for his developers conference speech, he stood on a podium with\nclicker  in  hand  and  spent  twenty  minutes  showing  slides  of  the  design  to  council\nmembers. When a rendering of the sleek, futuristic, perfectly circular building appeared\non the screen, he paused and smiled. “It’s like a spaceship has landed,” he said. A few\nmoments later he added, “I think we have a shot at building the best office building in\nthe world.”\nThe following Friday, Jobs sent an email to a colleague from the distant past, Ann\nBowers, the widow of Intel’s cofounder Bob Noyce. She had been Apple’s human\nresources director and den mother in the early 1980s, in charge of reprimanding Jobs\nafter his tantrums and tending to the wounds of his coworkers. Jobs asked if she would\ncome see him the next day. Bowers happened to be in New York, but she came by his\nhouse that Sunday when she returned. By then he was sick again, in pain and without\nmuch energy, but he was eager to show her the renderings of the new headquarters. “You\nshould be proud of Apple,” he said. “You should be proud of what we built.”\nThen he looked at her and asked, intently, a question that almost floored her: “Tell\nme, what was I like when I was young?”\nBowers tried to give him an honest answer. “You were very impetuous and very\ndifficult,” she replied. “But your vision was compelling. You told us, ‘The journey is\nthe reward.’ That turned out to be true.”\n“Yes,” Jobs answered. “I did learn some things along the way.” Then, a few minutes\nlater, he repeated it, as if to reassure Bowers and himself. “I did learn some things. I\nreally did.”\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-ONE\nROUND THREE\nThe Twilight Struggle\nFamily Ties\nJobs had an aching desire to make it to his son’s graduation from high school in June\n2010. “When I was diagnosed with cancer, I made my deal with God or whatever,\nwhich was that I really wanted to see Reed graduate, and that got me through 2009,” he\nsaid. As a senior, Reed looked eerily like his father at eighteen, with a knowing and\nslightly rebellious smile, intense eyes, and a shock of dark hair. But from his mother he\nhad inherited a sweetness and painfully sensitive empathy that his father lacked. He was\ndemonstrably affectionate and eager to please. Whenever his father was sitting sullenly\nat the kitchen table and staring at the floor, which happened often when he was ailing,\nthe only thing sure to cause his eyes to brighten was Reed walking in.\nReed adored his father. Soon after I started working on this book, he dropped in to\nwhere I was staying and, as his father often did, suggested we take a walk. He told me,\nwith an intensely earnest look, that his father was not a cold profit-seeking businessman\nbut was motivated by a love of what he did and a pride in the products he was making.\nAfter Jobs was diagnosed with cancer, Reed began spending his summers working in\na  Stanford  oncology  lab  doing  DNA  sequencing  to  find  genetic  markers  for  colon\ncancer. In one experiment, he traced how mutations go through families. “One of the\nvery few silver linings about me getting sick is that Reed’s gotten to spend a lot of time\nstudying with some very good doctors,” Jobs said. “His enthusiasm for it is exactly how\nI felt about computers when I was his age. I think the biggest innovations of the twenty-\nfirst century will be the intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning,\njust like the digital one was when I was his age.”\n\nReed used his cancer study as the basis for the senior report he presented to his class\nat Crystal Springs Uplands School. As he described how he used centrifuges and dyes\nto sequence the DNA of tumors, his father sat in the audience beaming, along with the\nrest of his family. “I fantasize about Reed getting a house here in Palo Alto with his\nfamily and riding his bike to work as a doctor at Stanford,” Jobs said afterward.\nReed had grown up fast in 2009, when it looked as if his father was going to die. He\ntook care of his younger sisters while his parents were in Memphis, and he developed a\nprotective paternalism. But when his father’s health stabilized in the spring of 2010, he\nregained his playful, teasing personality. One day during dinner he was discussing with\nhis family where to take his girlfriend for dinner. His father suggested Il Fornaio, an\nelegant standard in Palo Alto, but Reed said he had been unable to get reservations. “Do\nyou want me to try?” his father asked. Reed resisted; he wanted to handle it himself.\nErin, the somewhat shy middle child, suggested that she could outfit a tepee in their\ngarden and she and Eve, the younger sister, would serve them a romantic meal there.\nReed stood up and hugged her. He would take her up on that some other time, he\npromised.\nOne Saturday Reed was one of the four contestants on his school’s Quiz Kids team\ncompeting on a local TV station. The family—minus Eve, who was in a horse show—\ncame to cheer him on. As the television crew bumbled around getting ready, his father\ntried  to  keep  his  impatience  in  check  and  remain  inconspicuous  among  the  parents\nsitting in the rows of folding chairs. But he was clearly recognizable in his trademark\njeans and black turtleneck, and one woman pulled up a chair right next to him and\nstarted to take his picture. Without looking at her, he stood up and moved to the other\nend of the row. When Reed came on the set, his nameplate identified him as “Reed\nPowell.” The host asked the students what they wanted to be when they grew up. “A\ncancer researcher,” Reed answered.\nJobs drove his two-seat Mercedes SL55, taking Reed, while his wife followed in\nher own car with Erin. On the way home, she asked Erin why she thought her father\nrefused to have a license plate on his car. “To be a rebel,” she answered. I later put the\nquestion to Jobs. “Because people follow me sometimes, and if I have a license plate,\nthey can track down where I live,” he replied. “But that’s kind of getting obsolete now\nwith Google Maps. So I guess, really, it’s just because I don’t.”\nDuring Reed’s graduation ceremony, his father sent me an email from his iPhone that\nsimply  exulted,  “Today  is  one  of  my  happiest  days.  Reed  is  graduating  from  High\nSchool. Right now. And, against all odds, I am here.” That night there was a party at\ntheir  house  with  close  friends  and  family.  Reed  danced  with  every  member  of  his\nfamily, including his father. Later Jobs took his son out to the barnlike storage shed to\noffer him one of his two bicycles, which he wouldn’t be riding again. Reed joked that\nthe Italian one looked a bit too gay, so Jobs told him to take the solid eight-speed next to\nit.  When  Reed  said  he  would  be  indebted,  Jobs  answered,  “You  don’t  need  to  be\nindebted, because you have my DNA.” A few days later Toy Story 3 opened. Jobs had\n\nnurtured this Pixar trilogy from the beginning, and the final installment was about the\nemotions surrounding the departure of Andy for college. “I wish I could always be with\nyou,” Andy’s mother says. “You always will be,” he replies.\nHis middle daughter, Erin, had grown into a poised and attractive young woman,\nwith a personal sensitivity more mature than her father’s. She thought that she might\nwant to be an architect, perhaps because of her father’s interest in the field, and she had\na good sense of design.\nAt one point as I was finishing this book, Powell told me that Erin wanted to give me\nan interview. It’s not something that I would have requested, since she was then just\nturning sixteen, but I agreed. The point Erin emphasized was that she understood why\nher father was not always attentive, and she accepted that. “He does his best to be both\na father and the CEO of Apple, and he juggles those pretty well,” she said. “Sometimes\nI wish I had more of his attention, but I know the work he’s doing is very important and I\nthink it’s really cool, so I’m fine. I don’t really need more attention.”\nJobs had promised to take each of his children on a trip of their choice when they\nbecame  teenagers.  Reed  chose  to  go  to  Kyoto,  knowing  how  much  his  father  was\nentranced by the Zen calm of that beautiful city. Not surprisingly, when Erin turned\nthirteen, in 2008, she chose Kyoto as well. Her father’s illness caused him to cancel the\ntrip, so he promised to take her in 2010, when he was better. But that June he decided he\ndidn’t want to go. Erin was crestfallen but didn’t protest. Instead her mother took her to\nFrance with family friends, and they rescheduled the Kyoto trip for July.\nThe whole family took off in early July for Kona Village, Hawaii, which was the\nfirst leg of the trip. But in Hawaii Jobs developed a bad toothache, which he ignored, as\nif he could will the cavity away. The tooth collapsed and had to be fixed. Then the\niPhone 4 antenna crisis hit, and he decided to rush back to Cupertino, taking Reed with\nhim. Powell and Erin stayed in Hawaii, hoping that Jobs would return and continue with\nthe plans to take them to Kyoto.\nJobs did. While Reed took care of Eve back in Palo Alto, Erin and her parents\nstayed at the Tawaraya Ryokan, an inn of sublime simplicity that Jobs loved. “It was\nfantastic,” Erin recalled.\nTwenty years earlier Jobs had taken Erin’s half-sister, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, to Japan\nwhen she was about the same age. Among her strongest memories was sharing with him\ndelightful meals and watching him, usually such a picky eater, savor unagi sushi and\nother delicacies. Seeing him take joy in eating made Lisa feel relaxed with him for the\nfirst time. Erin recalled a similar experience: “Dad knew where he wanted to go to\nlunch every day. He told me he knew an incredible soba shop, and he took me there, and\nit was so good that it’s been hard to ever eat soba again because nothing comes close.”\nThey also found a tiny neighborhood sushi restaurant, and Jobs tagged it on his iPhone\nas “best sushi I’ve ever had.” Erin agreed.\nThey also visited Kyoto’s famous Zen Buddhist temples; the one Erin loved most\nwas Saiho ̄-ji, known as the “moss temple” because of its Golden Pond surrounded by\n\ngardens featuring more than a hundred varieties of moss. “Erin was really really happy,\nwhich  was  deeply  gratifying  and  helped  improve  her  relationship  with  her  father,”\nPowell recalled. “She deserved that.”\nTheir younger daughter, Eve, was spunky, self-assured, and in no way intimidated by\nher father. Her passion was horseback riding, and she became determined to make it to\nthe Olympics. When a coach told her how much work it would require, she replied,\n“Tell me exactly what I need to do. I will do it.” He did, and she began diligently\nfollowing the program.\nEve was an expert at the difficult task of pinning her father down; she often called\nhis assistant at work directly to make sure something got put on his calendar. She was\nalso pretty good as a negotiator. One weekend in 2010, when the family was planning a\ntrip, Erin wanted to delay the departure by half a day, but she was afraid to ask her\nfather. Eve, then twelve, volunteered to take on the task, and at dinner she laid out the\ncase to her father as if she were a lawyer before the Supreme Court. Jobs cut her off\n—“No,  I  don’t  think  I  want  to”—but  it  was  clear  that  he  was  more  amused  than\nannoyed. Later that evening Eve sat down with her mother and deconstructed the various\nways that she could have made her case better.\nJobs came to appreciate her spirit—and see a lot of himself in her. “She’s a pistol\nand has the strongest will of any kid I’ve ever met,” he said. “It’s like payback.” He had\na deep understanding of her personality, perhaps because it bore some resemblance to\nhis. “Eve is more sensitive than a lot of people think,” he explained. “She’s so smart\nthat she can roll over people a bit, so that means she can alienate people, and she finds\nherself alone. She’s in the process of learning how to be who she is, but tempers it\naround the edges so that she can have the friends that she needs.”\nJobs’s  relationship  with  his  wife  was  sometimes  complicated  but  always  loyal.\nSavvy and compassionate, Laurene Powell was a stabilizing influence and an example\nof his ability to compensate for some of his selfish impulses by surrounding himself\nwith strong-willed and sensible people. She weighed in quietly on business issues,\nfirmly on family concerns, and fiercely on medical matters. Early in their marriage, she\ncofounded  and  launched  College  Track,  a  national  after-school  program  that  helps\ndisadvantaged kids graduate from high school and get into college. Since then she had\nbecome a leading force in the education reform movement. Even though he tended to be\ngenerally dismissive of philanthropic endeavors, Jobs professed an admiration for his\nwife’s work: “What she’s done with College Track really impresses me.”\nIn February 2010 Jobs celebrated his fifty-fifth birthday with just his family. The\nkitchen was decorated with streamers and balloons, and his kids gave him a red-velvet\ntoy crown, which he wore. Now that he had recovered from a grueling year of health\nproblems,  he  resumed  his  focus  on  his  work.  “I  think  it  was  hard  on  the  family,\nespecially the girls,” she told me. “After two years of him being ill, he finally gets a\nlittle better, and they expected he would focus a bit on them, but he didn’t.” She wanted\nto make sure, she said, that both sides of his personality were reflected in this book and\n\nput  into  context.  “Like  many  great  men  whose  gifts  are  extraordinary,  he’s  not\nextraordinary in every realm,” she said. “He doesn’t have social graces, such as putting\nhimself in other people’s shoes, but he cares deeply about empowering humankind, the\nadvancement of humankind, and putting the right tools in their hands.”\nPresident Obama\nOn a trip to Washington in the early fall of 2010, Powell had met with some of her\nfriends at the White House who told her that President Obama was going to Silicon\nValley  that  October.  She  suggested  that  he  might  want  to  meet  with  her  husband.\nObama’s  aides  liked  the  idea;  it  fit  into  his  new  emphasis  on  competitiveness.  In\naddition, John Doerr, the venture capitalist who had become one of Jobs’s close friends,\nhad told a meeting of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board about Jobs’s\nviews on why the United States was losing its edge. He too suggested that Obama\nshould meet with Jobs. So a half hour was put on the president’s schedule for a session\nat the Westin San Francisco Airport.\nThere was one problem: When Powell told her husband, he said he didn’t want to do\nit. He was annoyed that she had arranged it behind his back. “I’m not going to get slotted\nin for a token meeting so that he can check off that he met with a CEO,” he told her. She\ninsisted that Obama was “really psyched to meet with you.” Jobs replied that if that\nwere the case, then Obama should call and personally ask for the meeting. The standoff\nwent on for five days. Jobs finally relented.\nThe meeting actually lasted forty-five minutes, and Jobs did not hold back. “You’re\nheaded for a one-term presidency,” Jobs told Obama at the outset. To prevent that, he\nsaid, the administration needed to be a lot more business-friendly. He described how\neasy it was to build a factory in China, and said that it was almost impossible to do so\nthese days in America, largely because of regulations and unnecessary costs.\nJobs also  attacked  America’s  education  system,  saying  that  it  was  hopelessly\nantiquated and crippled by union work rules. Until the teachers’ unions were broken,\nthere  was  almost  no  hope  for  education  reform.  Teachers  should  be  treated  as\nprofessionals, he said, not as industrial assembly-line workers. Principals should be\nable to hire and fire them based on how good they were. Schools should be staying open\nuntil at least 6 p.m. and be in session eleven months of the year. It was absurd, he\nadded, that American classrooms were still based on teachers standing at a board and\nusing textbooks. All books, learning materials, and assessments should be digital and\ninteractive, tailored to each student and providing feedback in real time.\nJobs offered to put together a group of six or seven CEOs who could really explain\nthe innovation challenges facing America, and the president accepted. So Jobs made a\nlist of people for a Washington meeting to be held in December. Unfortunately, after\n\nValerie Jarrett and other presidential aides had added names, the list had expanded to\nmore than twenty, with GE’s Jeffrey Immelt in the lead. Jobs sent Jarrett an email saying\nit was a bloated list and he had no intention of coming. In fact his health problems had\nflared anew by then, so he would not have been able to go in any case, as Doerr\nprivately explained to the president.\nIn February 2011, Doerr began making plans to host a small dinner for President\nObama in Silicon Valley. He and Jobs, along with their wives, went to dinner at Evvia,\na Greek restaurant in Palo Alto, to draw up a tight guest list. The dozen chosen tech\ntitans  included  Google’s  Eric  Schmidt,  Yahoo’s  Carol  Bartz,  Facebook’s  Mark\nZuckerberg, Cisco’s John Chambers, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Genentech’s Art Levinson,\nand Netflix’s Reed Hastings. Jobs’s attention to the details of the dinner extended to the\nfood. Doerr sent him the proposed menu, and he responded that some of the dishes\nproposed by the caterer—shrimp, cod, lentil salad—were far too fancy “and not who\nyou are, John.” He particularly objected to the dessert that was planned, a cream pie\ntricked out with chocolate truffles, but the White House advance staff overruled him by\ntelling the caterer that the president liked cream pie. Because Jobs had lost so much\nweight that he was easily chilled, Doerr kept the house so warm that Zuckerberg found\nhimself sweating profusely.\nJobs, sitting next to the president, kicked off the dinner by saying, “Regardless of our\npolitical persuasions, I want you to know that we’re here to do whatever you ask to help\nour country.” Despite that, the dinner initially became a litany of suggestions of what the\npresident could do for the businesses there. Chambers, for example, pushed a proposal\nfor  a  repatriation  tax  holiday  that  would  allow  major  corporations  to  avoid  tax\npayments  on  overseas  profits  if  they  brought  them  back  to  the  United  States  for\ninvestment during a certain period. The president was annoyed, and so was Zuckerberg,\nwho turned to Valerie Jarrett, sitting to his right, and whispered, “We should be talking\nabout what’s important to the country. Why is he just talking about what’s good for\nhim?”\nDoerr was able to refocus the discussion by calling on everyone to suggest a list of\naction items. When Jobs’s turn came, he stressed the need for more trained engineers\nand suggested that any foreign students who earned an engineering degree in the United\nStates should be given a visa to stay in the country. Obama said that could be done only\nin the context of the “Dream Act,” which would allow illegal aliens who arrived as\nminors  and  finished  high  school  to  become  legal  residents—something  that  the\nRepublicans had blocked. Jobs found this an annoying example of how politics can lead\nto paralysis. “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why\nthings can’t get done,” he recalled. “It infuriates me.”\nJobs went on to urge that a way be found to train more American engineers. Apple\nhad 700,000 factory workers employed in China, he said, and that was because it\nneeded 30,000 engineers on-site to support those workers. “You can’t find that many in\nAmerica to hire,” he said. These factory engineers did not have to be PhDs or geniuses;\n\nthey simply needed to have basic engineering skills for manufacturing. Tech schools,\ncommunity colleges, or trade schools could train them. “If you could educate these\nengineers,” he said, “we could move more manufacturing plants here.” The argument\nmade a strong impression on the president. Two or three times over the next month he\ntold his aides, “We’ve got to find ways to train those 30,000 manufacturing engineers\nthat Jobs told us about.”\nJobs was pleased that Obama followed up, and they talked by telephone a few times\nafter  the  meeting.  He  offered  to  help  create  Obama’s  political  ads  for  the  2012\ncampaign.  (He  had  made  the  same  offer  in  2008,  but  he’d  become  annoyed  when\nObama’s  strategist  David  Axelrod  wasn’t  totally  deferential.)  “I  think  political\nadvertising is terrible. I’d love to get Lee Clow out of retirement, and we can come up\nwith great commercials for him,” Jobs told me a few weeks after the dinner. Jobs had\nbeen fighting pain all week, but the talk of politics energized him. “Every once in a\nwhile,  a  real  ad  pro  gets  involved,  the  way  Hal  Riney  did  with  ‘It’s  morning  in\nAmerica’ for Reagan’s reelection in 1984. So that’s what I’d like to do for Obama.”\nThird Medical Leave, 2011\nThe cancer always sent signals as it reappeared. Jobs had learned that. He would lose\nhis appetite and begin to feel pains throughout his body. His doctors would do tests,\ndetect nothing, and reassure him that he still seemed clear. But he knew better. The\ncancer had its signaling pathways, and a few months after he felt the signs the doctors\nwould discover that it was indeed no longer in remission.\nAnother such downturn began in early November 2010. He was in pain, stopped\neating, and had to be fed intravenously by a nurse who came to the house. The doctors\nfound  no  sign  of  more  tumors,  and  they  assumed  that  this  was  just  another  of  his\nperiodic cycles of fighting infections and digestive maladies. He had never been one to\nsuffer pain stoically, so his doctors and family had become somewhat inured to his\ncomplaints.\nHe and his family went to Kona Village for Thanksgiving, but his eating did not\nimprove. The dining there was in a communal room, and the other guests pretended not\nto notice as Jobs, looking emaciated, rocked and moaned at meals, not touching his\nfood. It was a testament to the resort and its guests that his condition never leaked out.\nWhen he returned to Palo Alto, Jobs became increasingly emotional and morose. He\nthought he was going to die, he told his kids, and he would get choked up about the\npossibility that he would never celebrate any more of their birthdays.\nBy Christmas he was down to 115 pounds, which was more than fifty pounds below\nhis normal weight. Mona Simpson came to Palo Alto for the holiday, along with her ex-\nhusband, the television comedy writer Richard Appel, and their children. The mood\n\npicked up a bit. The families played parlor games such as Novel, in which participants\ntry  to  fool  each  other  by  seeing  who  can  write  the  most  convincing  fake  opening\nsentence to a book, and things seemed to be looking up for a while. He was even able to\ngo out to dinner at a restaurant with Powell a few days after Christmas. The kids went\noff on a ski vacation for New Year’s, with Powell and Mona Simpson taking turns\nstaying at home with Jobs in Palo Alto.\nBy the beginning of 2011, however, it was clear that this was not merely one of his\nbad  patches.  His  doctors  detected  evidence  of  new  tumors,  and  the  cancer-related\nsignaling further exacerbated his loss of appetite. They were struggling to determine\nhow much drug therapy his body, in its emaciated condition, would be able to take.\nEvery inch of his body felt like it had been punched, he told friends, as he moaned and\nsometimes doubled over in pain.\nIt was a vicious cycle. The first signs of cancer caused pain. The morphine and other\npainkillers he took suppressed his appetite. His pancreas had been partly removed and\nhis  liver  had  been  replaced,  so  his  digestive  system  was  faulty  and  had  trouble\nabsorbing  protein.  Losing  weight  made  it  harder  to  embark  on  aggressive  drug\ntherapies. His emaciated condition also made him more susceptible to infections, as did\nthe immunosuppressants he sometimes took to keep his body from rejecting his liver\ntransplant. The weight loss reduced the lipid layers around his pain receptors, causing\nhim to suffer more. And he was prone to extreme mood swings, marked by prolonged\nbouts of anger and depression, which further suppressed his appetite.\nJobs’s  eating  problems  were  exacerbated  over  the  years  by  his  psychological\nattitude toward food. When he was young, he learned that he could induce euphoria and\necstasy  by  fasting.  So  even  though  he  knew  that  he  should  eat—his  doctors  were\nbegging him to consume high-quality protein—lingering in the back of his subconscious,\nhe admitted, was his instinct for fasting and for diets like Arnold Ehret’s fruit regimen\nthat he had embraced as a teenager. Powell kept telling him that it was crazy, even\npointing out that Ehret had died at fifty-six when he stumbled and knocked his head, and\nshe would get angry when he came to the table and just stared silently at his lap. “I\nwanted him to force himself to eat,” she said, “and it was incredibly tense at home.”\nBryar Brown, their part-time cook, would still come in the afternoon and make an array\nof healthy dishes, but Jobs would touch his tongue to one or two dishes and then dismiss\nthem all as inedible. One evening he announced, “I could probably eat a little pumpkin\npie,” and the even-tempered Brown created a beautiful pie from scratch in an hour. Jobs\nate only one bite, but Brown was thrilled.\nPowell  talked  to  eating  disorder  specialists  and  psychiatrists,  but  her  husband\ntended to shun them. He refused to take any medications, or be treated in any way, for\nhis depression. “When you have feelings,” he said, “like sadness or anger about your\ncancer or your plight, to mask them is to lead an artificial life.” In fact he swung to the\nother extreme. He became morose, tearful, and dramatic as he lamented to all around\n\nhim that he was about to die. The depression became part of the vicious cycle by\nmaking him even less likely to eat.\nPictures and videos of Jobs looking emaciated began to appear online, and soon\nrumors were swirling about how sick he was. The problem, Powell realized, was that\nthe  rumors  were  true,  and  they  were  not  going  to  go  away.  Jobs  had  agreed  only\nreluctantly to go on medical leave two years earlier, when his liver was failing, and this\ntime he also resisted the idea. It would be like leaving his homeland, unsure that he\nwould ever return. When he finally bowed to the inevitable, in January 2011, the board\nmembers were expecting it; the telephone meeting in which he told them that he wanted\nanother  leave  took  only  three  minutes.  He  had  often  discussed  with  the  board,  in\nexecutive session, his thoughts about who could take over if anything happened to him,\npresenting both short-term and longer-term combinations of options. But there was no\ndoubt that, in this current situation, Tim Cook would again take charge of day-to-day\noperations.\nThe following Saturday afternoon, Jobs allowed his wife to convene a meeting of his\ndoctors. He realized that he was facing the type of problem that he never permitted at\nApple.  His  treatment  was  fragmented  rather  than  integrated.  Each  of  his  myriad\nmaladies  was  being  treated  by  different  specialists—oncologists,  pain  specialists,\nnutritionists, hepatologists, and hematologists—but they were not being coordinated in a\ncohesive approach, the way James Eason had done in Memphis. “One of the big issues\nin  the  health  care  industry  is  the  lack  of  caseworkers  or  advocates  that  are  the\nquarterback of each team,” Powell said. This was particularly true at Stanford, where\nnobody seemed in charge of figuring out how nutrition was related to pain care and to\noncology. So Powell asked the various Stanford specialists to come to their house for a\nmeeting that also included some outside doctors with a more aggressive and integrated\napproach, such as David Agus of USC. They agreed on a new regimen for dealing with\nthe pain and for coordinating the other treatments.\nThanks to some pioneering science, the team of doctors had been able to keep Jobs\none step ahead of the cancer. He had become one of the first twenty people in the world\nto have all of the genes of his cancer tumor as well as of his normal DNA sequenced. It\nwas a process that, at the time, cost more than $100,000.\nThe gene sequencing and analysis were done collaboratively by teams at Stanford,\nJohns Hopkins, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. By knowing the unique\ngenetic and molecular signature of Jobs’s tumors, his doctors had been able to pick\nspecific drugs that directly targeted the defective molecular pathways that caused his\ncancer  cells  to  grow  in  an  abnormal  manner.  This  approach,  known  as  molecular\ntargeted therapy, was more effective than traditional chemotherapy, which attacks the\nprocess of division of all the body’s cells, cancerous or not. This targeted therapy was\nnot a silver bullet, but at times it seemed close to one: It allowed his doctors to look at\na  large  number  of  drugs—common  and  uncommon,  already  available  or  only  in\n\ndevelopment—to see which three or four might work best. Whenever his cancer mutated\nand repaved around one of these drugs, the doctors had another drug lined up to go next.\nAlthough Powell was diligent in overseeing her husband’s care, he was the one who\nmade the final decision on each new treatment regimen. A typical example occurred in\nMay 2011, when he held a meeting with George Fisher and other doctors from Stanford,\nthe gene-sequencing analysts from the Broad Institute, and his outside consultant David\nAgus. They all gathered around a table at a suite in the Four Seasons hotel in Palo Alto.\nPowell did not come, but their son, Reed, did. For three hours there were presentations\nfrom the Stanford and Broad researchers on the new information they had learned about\nthe genetic signatures of his cancer. Jobs was his usual feisty self. At one point he\nstopped a Broad Institute analyst who had made the mistake of using PowerPoint slides.\nJobs chided him and explained why Apple’s Keynote presentation software was better;\nhe even offered to teach him how to use it. By the end of the meeting, Jobs and his team\nhad gone through all of the molecular data, assessed the rationales for each of the\npotential therapies, and come up with a list of tests to help them better prioritize these.\nOne of his doctors told him that there was hope that his cancer, and others like it,\nwould soon be considered a manageable chronic disease, which could be kept at bay\nuntil the patient died of something else. “I’m either going to be one of the first to be able\nto outrun a cancer like this, or I’m going to be one of the last to die from it,” Jobs told\nme right after one of the meetings with his doctors. “Either among the first to make it to\nshore, or the last to get dumped.”\nVisitors\nWhen his 2011 medical leave was announced, the situation seemed so dire that Lisa\nBrennan-Jobs got back in touch after more than a year and arranged to fly from New\nYork the following week. Her relationship with her father had been built on layers of\nresentment. She was understandably scarred by having been pretty much abandoned by\nhim  for  her  first  ten  years.  Making  matters  worse,  she  had  inherited  some  of  his\nprickliness and, he felt, some of her mother’s sense of grievance. “I told her many times\nthat I wished I’d been a better dad when she was five, but now she should let things go\nrather than be angry the rest of her life,” he recalled just before Lisa arrived.\nThe visit went well. Jobs was beginning to feel a little better, and he was in a mood\nto mend fences and express his affection for those around him. At age thirty-two, Lisa\nwas in a serious relationship for one of the first times in her life. Her boyfriend was a\nstruggling young filmmaker from California, and Jobs went so far as to suggest she\nmove back to Palo Alto if they got married. “Look, I don’t know how long I am for this\nworld,” he told her. “The doctors can’t really tell me. If you want to see more of me,\nyou’re going to have to move out here. Why don’t you consider it?” Even though Lisa\n\ndid not move west, Jobs was pleased at how the reconciliation had worked out. “I\nhadn’t  been  sure  I  wanted  her  to  visit,  because  I  was  sick  and  didn’t  want  other\ncomplications. But I’m very glad she came. It helped settle a lot of things in me.”\nJobs had another visit that month from someone who wanted to repair fences. Google’s\ncofounder Larry Page, who lived less than three blocks away, had just announced plans\nto retake the reins of the company from Eric Schmidt. He knew how to flatter Jobs: He\nasked if he could come by and get tips on how to be a good CEO. Jobs was still furious\nat Google. “My first thought was, ‘Fuck you,’” he recounted. “But then I thought about it\nand realized that everybody helped me when I was young, from Bill Hewlett to the guy\ndown the block who worked for HP. So I called him back and said sure.” Page came\nover, sat in Jobs’s living room, and listened to his ideas on building great products and\ndurable companies. Jobs recalled:\nWe talked a lot about focus. And choosing people. How to know who to trust, and how\nto build a team of lieutenants he can count on. I described the blocking and tackling he\nwould have to do to keep the company from getting flabby or being larded with B\nplayers. The main thing I stressed was focus. Figure out what Google wants to be when\nit grows up. It’s now all over the map. What are the five products you want to focus on?\nGet  rid  of  the  rest,  because  they’re  dragging  you  down.  They’re  turning  you  into\nMicrosoft. They’re causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great. I\ntried to be as helpful as I could. I will continue to do that with people like Mark\nZuckerberg too. That’s how I’m going to spend part of the time I have left. I can help the\nnext generation remember the lineage of great companies here and how to continue the\ntradition. The Valley has been very supportive of me. I should do my best to repay.\nThe  announcement  of  Jobs’s  2011  medical  leave  prompted  others  to  make  a\npilgrimage to the house in Palo Alto. Bill Clinton, for example, came by and talked\nabout everything from the Middle East to American politics. But the most poignant visit\nwas from the other tech prodigy born in 1955, the guy who, for more than three decades,\nhad been Jobs’s rival and partner in defining the age of personal computers.\nBill Gates had never lost his fascination with Jobs. In the spring of 2011 I was at a\ndinner with him in Washington, where he had come to discuss his foundation’s global\nhealth endeavors. He expressed amazement at the success of the iPad and how Jobs,\neven while sick, was focusing on ways to improve it. “Here I am, merely saving the\nworld from malaria and that sort of thing, and Steve is still coming up with amazing new\nproducts,” he said wistfully. “Maybe I should have stayed in that game.” He smiled to\nmake sure that I knew he was joking, or at least half joking.\n\nThrough their mutual friend Mike Slade, Gates made arrangements to visit Jobs in\nMay. The day before it was supposed to happen, Jobs’s assistant called to say he wasn’t\nfeeling well enough. But it was rescheduled, and early one afternoon Gates drove to\nJobs’s house, walked through the back gate to the open kitchen door, and saw Eve\nstudying at the table. “Is Steve around?” he asked. Eve pointed him to the living room.\nThey spent more than three hours together, just the two of them, reminiscing. “We\nwere like the old guys in the industry looking back,” Jobs recalled. “He was happier\nthan  I’ve  ever  seen  him,  and  I  kept  thinking  how  healthy  he  looked.”  Gates  was\nsimilarly struck by how Jobs, though scarily gaunt, had more energy than he expected.\nHe was open about his health problems and, at least that day, feeling optimistic. His\nsequential regimens of targeted drug treatments, he told Gates, were like “jumping from\none lily pad to another,” trying to stay a step ahead of the cancer.\nJobs asked some questions about education, and Gates sketched out his vision of\nwhat schools in the future would be like, with students watching lectures and video\nlessons  on  their  own  while  using  the  classroom  time  for  discussions  and  problem\nsolving. They agreed that computers had, so far, made surprisingly little impact on\nschools—far less than on other realms of society such as media and medicine and law.\nFor that to change, Gates said, computers and mobile devices would have to focus on\ndelivering more personalized lessons and providing motivational feedback.\nThey also talked a lot about the joys of family, including how lucky they were to\nhave good kids and be married to the right women. “We laughed about how fortunate it\nwas that he met Laurene, and she’s kept him semi-sane, and I met Melinda, and she’s\nkept me semi-sane,” Gates recalled. “We also discussed how it’s challenging to be one\nof our children, and how do we mitigate that. It was pretty personal.” At one point Eve,\nwho in the past had been in horse shows with Gates’s daughter Jennifer, wandered in\nfrom the kitchen, and Gates asked her what jumping routines she liked best.\nAs their hours together drew to a close, Gates complimented Jobs on “the incredible\nstuff” he had created and for being able to save Apple in the late 1990s from the bozos\nwho were about to destroy it. He even made an interesting concession. Throughout their\ncareers they had adhered to competing philosophies on one of the most fundamental of\nall digital issues: whether hardware and software should be tightly integrated or more\nopen. “I used to believe that the open, horizontal model would prevail,” Gates told him.\n“But  you  proved  that  the  integrated,  vertical  model  could  also  be  great.”  Jobs\nresponded with his own admission. “Your model worked too,” he said.\nThey were both right. Each model had worked in the realm of personal computers,\nwhere Macintosh coexisted with a variety of Windows machines, and that was likely to\nbe true in the realm of mobile devices as well. But after recounting their discussion,\nGates added a caveat: “The integrated approach works well when Steve is at the helm.\nBut it doesn’t mean it will win many rounds in the future.” Jobs similarly felt compelled\nto add a caveat about Gates after describing their meeting: “Of course, his fragmented\n\nmodel worked, but it didn’t make really great products. It produced crappy products.\nThat was the problem. The big problem. At least over time.”\n“That Day Has Come”\nJobs had many other ideas and projects that he hoped to develop. He wanted to disrupt\nthe textbook industry and save the spines of spavined students bearing backpacks by\ncreating electronic texts and curriculum material for the iPad. He was also working\nwith Bill Atkinson, his friend from the original Macintosh team, on devising new digital\ntechnologies that worked at the pixel level to allow people to take great photographs\nusing their iPhones even in situations without much light. And he very much wanted to\ndo for television sets what he had done for computers, music players, and phones: make\nthem  simple  and  elegant.  “I’d  like  to  create  an  integrated  television  set  that  is\ncompletely easy to use,” he told me. “It would be seamlessly synced with all of your\ndevices and with iCloud.” No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes\nfor DVD players and cable channels. “It will have the simplest user interface you could\nimagine. I finally cracked it.”\nBut by July 2011, his cancer had spread to his bones and other parts of his body, and\nhis doctors were having trouble finding targeted drugs that could beat it back. He was in\npain, sleeping erratically, had little energy, and stopped going to work. He and Powell\nhad reserved a sailboat for a family cruise scheduled for the end of that month, but those\nplans were scuttled. He was eating almost no solid food, and he spent most of his days\nin his bedroom watching television.\nIn August, I got a message that he wanted me to come visit. When I arrived at his\nhouse, at mid-morning on a Saturday, he was still asleep, so I sat with his wife and kids\nin the garden, filled with a profusion of yellow roses and various types of daisies, until\nhe sent word that I should come in. I found him curled up on the bed, wearing khaki\nshorts and a white turtleneck. His legs were shockingly sticklike, but his smile was easy\nand his mind quick. “We better hurry, because I have very little energy,” he said.\nHe wanted to show me some of his personal pictures and let me pick a few to use in\nthe book. Because he was too weak to get out of bed, he pointed to various drawers in\nthe room, and I carefully brought him the photographs in each. As I sat on the side of the\nbed, I held them up, one at a time, so he could see them. Some prompted stories; others\nmerely elicited a grunt or a smile. I had never seen a picture of his father, Paul Jobs, and\nI was startled when I came across a snapshot of a handsome hardscrabble 1950s dad\nholding a toddler. “Yes, that’s him,” he said. “You can use it.” He then pointed to a box\nnear the window that contained a picture of his father looking at him lovingly at his\nwedding. “He was a great man,” Jobs said quietly. I murmured something along the\n\nlines of “He would have been proud of you.” Jobs corrected me: “He was proud of\nme.”\nFor a while, the pictures seemed to energize him. We discussed what various people\nfrom his past, ranging from Tina Redse to Mike Markkula to Bill Gates, now thought of\nhim. I recounted what Gates had said after he described his last visit with Jobs, which\nwas that Apple had shown that the integrated approach could work, but only “when\nSteve is at the helm.” Jobs thought that was silly. “Anyone could make better products\nthat way, not just me,” he said. So I asked him to name another company that made great\nproducts by insisting on end-to-end integration. He thought for a while, trying to come\nup with an example. “The car companies,” he finally said, but then he added, “Or at\nleast they used to.”\nWhen our discussion turned to the sorry state of the economy and politics, he offered\na  few  sharp  opinions  about  the  lack  of  strong  leadership  around  the  world.  “I’m\ndisappointed in Obama,” he said. “He’s having trouble leading because he’s reluctant to\noffend people or piss them off.” He caught what I was thinking and assented with a little\nsmile: “Yes, that’s not a problem I ever had.”\nAfter two hours, he grew quiet, so I got off the bed and started to leave. “Wait,” he\nsaid, as he waved to me to sit back down. It took a minute or two for him to regain\nenough energy to talk. “I had a lot of trepidation about this project,” he finally said,\nreferring to his decision to cooperate with this book. “I was really worried.”\n“Why did you do it?” I asked.\n“I wanted my kids to know me,” he said. “I wasn’t always there for them, and I\nwanted them to know why and to understand what I did. Also, when I got sick, I realized\nother people would write about me if I died, and they wouldn’t know anything. They’d\nget it all wrong. So I wanted to make sure someone heard what I had to say.”\nHe had never, in two years, asked anything about what I was putting in the book or\nwhat conclusions I had drawn. But now he looked at me and said, “I know there will be\na lot in your book I won’t like.” It was more a question than a statement, and when he\nstared at me for a response, I nodded, smiled, and said I was sure that would be true.\n“That’s good,” he said. “Then it won’t seem like an in-house book. I won’t read it for a\nwhile, because I don’t want to get mad. Maybe I will read it in a year—if I’m still\naround.” By then, his eyes were closed and his energy gone, so I quietly took my leave.\nAs  his  health  deteriorated  throughout  the  summer,  Jobs  slowly  began  to  face  the\ninevitable: He would not be returning to Apple as CEO. So it was time for him to\nresign.  He  wrestled  with  the  decision  for  weeks,  discussing  it  with  his  wife,  Bill\nCampbell, Jony Ive, and George Riley. “One of the things I wanted to do for Apple was\nto set an example of how you do a transfer of power right,” he told me. He joked about\nall the rough transitions that had occurred at the company over the past thirty-five years.\n\n“It’s always been a drama, like a third-world country. Part of my goal has been to make\nApple the world’s best company, and having an orderly transition is key to that.”\nThe best time and place to make the transition, he decided, was at the company’s\nregularly scheduled August 24 board meeting. He was eager to do it in person, rather\nthan merely send in a letter or attend by phone, so he had been pushing himself to eat\nand regain strength. The day before the meeting, he decided he could make it, but he\nneeded  the  help  of  a  wheelchair.  Arrangements  were  made  to  have  him  driven  to\nheadquarters and wheeled to the boardroom as secretly as possible.\nHe arrived just before 11 a.m., when the board members were finishing committee\nreports and other routine business. Most knew what was about to happen. But instead of\ngoing right to the topic on everyone’s mind, Tim Cook and Peter Oppenheimer, the chief\nfinancial officer, went through the results for the quarter and the projections for the year\nahead. Then Jobs said quietly that he had something personal to say. Cook asked if he\nand the other top managers should leave, and Jobs paused for more than thirty seconds\nbefore he decided they should. Once the room was cleared of all but the six outside\ndirectors, he began to read aloud from a letter he had dictated and revised over the\nprevious weeks. “I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer\nmeet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know,”\nit began. “Unfortunately, that day has come.”\nThe letter was simple, direct, and only eight sentences long. In it he suggested that\nCook replace him, and he offered to serve as chairman of the board. “I believe Apple’s\nbrightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and\ncontributing to its success in a new role.”\nThere was a long silence. Al Gore was the first to speak, and he listed Jobs’s\naccomplishments during his tenure. Mickey Drexler added that watching Jobs transform\nApple was “the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen in business,” and Art Levinson\npraised Jobs’s diligence in ensuring that there was a smooth transition. Campbell said\nnothing, but there were tears in his eyes as the formal resolutions transferring power\nwere passed.\nOver lunch, Scott Forstall and Phil Schiller came in to display mock-ups of some\nproducts  that  Apple  had  in  the  pipeline.  Jobs  peppered  them  with  questions  and\nthoughts, especially about what capacities the fourth-generation cellular networks might\nhave and what features needed to be in future phones. At one point Forstall showed off\na voice recognition app. As he feared, Jobs grabbed the phone in the middle of the\ndemo and proceeded to see if he could confuse it. “What’s the weather in Palo Alto?”\nhe asked. The app answered. After a few more questions, Jobs challenged it: “Are you\na man or a woman?” Amazingly, the app answered in its robotic voice, “They did not\nassign me a gender.” For a moment the mood lightened.\nWhen the talk turned to tablet computing, some expressed a sense of triumph that HP\nhad suddenly given up the field, unable to compete with the iPad. But Jobs turned\nsomber and declared that it was actually a sad moment. “Hewlett and Packard built a\n\ngreat company, and they thought they had left it in good hands,” he said. “But now it’s\nbeing dismembered and destroyed. It’s tragic. I hope I’ve left a stronger legacy so that\nwill never happen at Apple.” As he prepared to leave, the board members gathered\naround to give him a hug.\nAfter meeting with his executive team to explain the news, Jobs rode home with\nGeorge Riley. When they arrived at the house, Powell was in the backyard harvesting\nhoney from her hives, with help from Eve. They took off their screen helmets and\nbrought the honey pot to the kitchen, where Reed and Erin had gathered, so that they\ncould  all  celebrate  the  graceful  transition.  Jobs  took  a  spoonful  of  the  honey  and\npronounced it wonderfully sweet.\nThat evening, he stressed to me that his hope was to remain as active as his health\nallowed. “I’m going to work on new products and marketing and the things that I like,”\nhe said. But when I asked how it really felt to be relinquishing control of the company\nhe had built, his tone turned wistful, and he shifted into the past tense. “I’ve had a very\nlucky career, a very lucky life,” he replied. “I’ve done all that I can do.”\n\nCHAPTER FORTY-TWO\nLEGACY\nThe Brightest Heaven of Invention\nAt the 2006 Macworld, in front of a slide of him and Wozniak from thirty years earlier\nFireWire\nHis personality was reflected in the products he created. Just as the core of Apple’s\nphilosophy, from the original Macintosh in 1984 to the iPad a generation later, was the\nend-to-end integration of hardware and software, so too was it the case with Steve\nJobs: His passions, perfectionism, demons, desires, artistry, devilry, and obsession for\n\ncontrol were integrally connected to his approach to business and the products that\nresulted.\nThe unified field theory that ties together Jobs’s personality and products begins\nwith his most salient trait: his intensity. His silences could be as searing as his rants; he\nhad taught himself to stare without blinking. Sometimes this intensity was charming, in a\ngeeky way, such as when he was explaining the profundity of Bob Dylan’s music or why\nwhatever product he was unveiling at that moment was the most amazing thing that\nApple had ever made. At other times it could be terrifying, such as when he was\nfulminating about Google or Microsoft ripping off Apple.\nThis intensity encouraged a binary view of the world. Colleagues referred to the\nhero/shithead dichotomy. You were either one or the other, sometimes on the same day.\nThe same was true of products, ideas, even food: Something was either “the best thing\never,” or it was shitty, brain-dead, inedible. As a result, any perceived flaw could set\noff a rant. The finish on a piece of metal, the curve of the head of a screw, the shade of\nblue on a box, the intuitiveness of a navigation screen—he would declare them to\n“completely suck” until that moment when he suddenly pronounced them “absolutely\nperfect.” He thought of himself as an artist, which he was, and he indulged in the\ntemperament of one.\nHis quest for perfection led to his compulsion for Apple to have end-to-end control\nof every product that it made. He got hives, or worse, when contemplating great Apple\nsoftware running on another company’s crappy hardware, and he likewise was allergic\nto  the  thought  of  unapproved  apps  or  content  polluting  the  perfection  of  an  Apple\ndevice. This ability to integrate hardware and software and content into one unified\nsystem enabled him to impose simplicity. The astronomer Johannes Kepler declared that\n“nature loves simplicity and unity.” So did Steve Jobs.\nThis  instinct  for  integrated  systems  put  him  squarely  on  one  side  of  the  most\nfundamental divide in the digital world: open versus closed. The hacker ethos handed\ndown from the Homebrew Computer Club favored the open approach, in which there\nwas little centralized control and people were free to modify hardware and software,\nshare code, write to open standards, shun proprietary systems, and have content and\napps that were compatible with a variety of devices and operating systems. The young\nWozniak was in that camp: The Apple II he designed was easily opened and sported\nplenty of slots and ports that people could jack into as they pleased. With the Macintosh\nJobs became a founding father of the other camp. The Macintosh would be like an\nappliance,  with  the  hardware  and  software  tightly  woven  together  and  closed  to\nmodifications. The hacker ethos would be sacrificed in order to create a seamless and\nsimple user experience.\nThis led Jobs to decree that the Macintosh operating system would not be available\nfor any other company’s hardware. Microsoft pursued the opposite strategy, allowing its\nWindows operating system to be promiscuously licensed. That did not produce the most\nelegant computers, but it did lead to Microsoft’s dominating the world of operating\n\nsystems. After Apple’s market share shrank to less than 5%, Microsoft’s approach was\ndeclared the winner in the personal computer realm.\nIn the longer run, however, there proved to be some advantages to Jobs’s model.\nEven with a small market share, Apple was able to maintain a huge profit margin while\nother computer makers were commoditized. In 2010, for example, Apple had just 7% of\nthe revenue in the personal computer market, but it grabbed 35% of the operating profit.\nMore significantly, in the early 2000s Jobs’s insistence on end-to-end integration\ngave Apple an advantage in developing a digital hub strategy, which allowed your\ndesktop computer to link seamlessly with a variety of portable devices. The iPod, for\nexample, was part of a closed and tightly integrated system. To use it, you had to use\nApple’s iTunes software and download content from its iTunes Store. The result was\nthat the iPod, like the iPhone and iPad that followed, was an elegant delight in contrast\nto the kludgy rival products that did not offer a seamless end-to-end experience.\nThe strategy worked. In May 2000 Apple’s market value was one-twentieth that of\nMicrosoft.  In  May  2010  Apple  surpassed  Microsoft  as  the  world’s  most  valuable\ntechnology company, and by September 2011 it was worth 70% more than Microsoft. In\nthe first quarter of 2011 the market for Windows PCs shrank by 1%, while the market\nfor Macs grew 28%.\nBy then the battle had begun anew in the world of mobile devices. Google took the\nmore open approach, and it made its Android operating system available for use by any\nmaker  of  tablets  or  cell  phones.  By  2011  its  share  of  the  mobile  market  matched\nApple’s. The drawback of Android’s openness was the fragmentation that resulted.\nVarious  handset  and  tablet  makers  modified  Android  into  dozens  of  variants  and\nflavors, making it hard for apps to remain consistent or make full use of its features.\nThere were merits to both approaches. Some people wanted the freedom to use more\nopen systems and have more choices of hardware; others clearly preferred Apple’s tight\nintegration and control, which led to products that had simpler interfaces, longer battery\nlife, greater user-friendliness, and easier handling of content.\nThe downside of Jobs’s approach was that his desire to delight the user led him to\nresist  empowering  the  user.  Among  the  most  thoughtful  proponents  of  an  open\nenvironment is Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard. He begins his book The  Future  of  the\nInternet—And  How  to  Stop  It with the scene of Jobs introducing the iPhone, and he\nwarns of the consequences of replacing personal computers with “sterile appliances\ntethered to a network of control.” Even more fervent is Cory Doctorow, who wrote a\nmanifesto  called  “Why  I  Won’t  Buy  an  iPad”  for  Boing  Boing.  “There’s  a  lot  of\nthoughtfulness and smarts that went into the design. But there’s also a palpable contempt\nfor the owner,” he wrote. “Buying an iPad for your kids isn’t a means of jump-starting\nthe realization that the world is yours to take apart and reassemble; it’s a way of telling\nyour offspring that even changing the batteries is something you have to leave to the\nprofessionals.”\n\nFor Jobs, belief in an integrated approach was a matter of righteousness. “We do\nthese things not because we are control freaks,” he explained. “We do them because we\nwant to make great products, because we care about the user, and because we like to\ntake responsibility for the entire experience rather than turn out the crap that other\npeople make.” He also believed he was doing people a service: “They’re busy doing\nwhatever  they  do  best,  and  they  want  us  to  do  what  we  do  best.  Their  lives  are\ncrowded; they have other things to do than think about how to integrate their computers\nand devices.”\nThis approach sometimes went against Apple’s short-term business interests. But in\na world filled with junky devices, inscrutable error messages, and annoying interfaces,\nit led to astonishing products marked by beguiling user experiences. Using an Apple\nproduct could be as sublime as walking in one of the Zen gardens of Kyoto that Jobs\nloved, and neither experience was created by worshipping at the altar of openness or by\nletting a thousand flowers bloom. Sometimes it’s nice to be in the hands of a control\nfreak.\n*\nJobs’s intensity was also evident in his ability to focus. He would set priorities, aim his\nlaser attention on them, and filter out distractions. If something engaged him—the user\ninterface for the original Macintosh, the design of the iPod and iPhone, getting music\ncompanies into the iTunes Store—he was relentless. But if he did not want to deal with\nsomething—a legal annoyance, a business issue, his cancer diagnosis, a family tug—he\nwould resolutely ignore it. That focus allowed him to say no. He got Apple back on\ntrack by cutting all except a few core products. He made devices simpler by eliminating\nbuttons, software simpler by eliminating features, and interfaces simpler by eliminating\noptions.\nHe attributed his ability to focus and his love of simplicity to his Zen training. It\nhoned his appreciation for intuition, showed him how to filter out anything that was\ndistracting or unnecessary, and nurtured in him an aesthetic based on minimalism.\nUnfortunately his Zen training never quite produced in him a Zen-like calm or inner\nserenity, and that too is part of his legacy. He was often tightly coiled and impatient,\ntraits he made no effort to hide. Most people have a regulator between their mind and\nmouth that modulates their brutish sentiments and spikiest impulses. Not Jobs. He made\na point of being brutally honest. “My job is to say when something sucks rather than\nsugarcoat it,” he said. This made him charismatic and inspiring, yet also, to use the\ntechnical term, an asshole at times.\nAndy Hertzfeld once told me, “The one question I’d truly love Steve to answer is,\n‘Why are you sometimes so mean?’” Even his family members wondered whether he\nsimply lacked the filter that restrains people from venting their wounding thoughts or\nwillfully bypassed it. Jobs claimed it was the former. “This is who I am, and you can’t\n\nexpect me to be someone I’m not,” he replied when I asked him the question. But I think\nhe actually could have controlled himself, if he had wanted. When he hurt people, it was\nnot because he was lacking in emotional awareness. Quite the contrary: He could size\npeople up, understand their inner thoughts, and know how to relate to them, cajole them,\nor hurt them at will.\nThe nasty edge to his personality was not necessary. It hindered him more than it\nhelped him. But it did, at times, serve a purpose. Polite and velvety leaders, who take\ncare to avoid bruising others, are generally not as effective at forcing change. Dozens of\nthe colleagues whom Jobs most abused ended their litany of horror stories by saying\nthat he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. And he created a corporation\ncrammed with A players.\nThe saga of Steve Jobs is the Silicon Valley creation myth writ large: launching a\nstartup in his parents’ garage and building it into the world’s most valuable company.\nHe didn’t invent many things outright, but he was a master at putting together ideas, art,\nand technology in ways that invented the future. He designed the Mac after appreciating\nthe power of graphical interfaces in a way that Xerox was unable to do, and he created\nthe iPod after grasping the joy of having a thousand songs in your pocket in a way that\nSony, which had all the assets and heritage, never could accomplish. Some leaders push\ninnovations by being good at the big picture. Others do so by mastering details. Jobs did\nboth, relentlessly. As a result he launched a series of products over three decades that\ntransformed whole industries:\nThe  Apple  II,  which  took  Wozniak’s  circuit  board  and  turned  it  into  the  first\npersonal computer that was not just for hobbyists.\nThe  Macintosh,  which  begat  the  home  computer  revolution  and  popularized\ngraphical user interfaces.\nToy  Story and other Pixar blockbusters, which opened up the miracle of digital\nimagination.\nApple stores, which reinvented the role of a store in defining a brand.\nThe iPod, which changed the way we consume music.\nThe iTunes Store, which saved the music industry.\nThe iPhone, which turned mobile phones into music, photography, video, email,\nand web devices.\nThe App Store, which spawned a new content-creation industry.\nThe  iPad,  which  launched  tablet  computing  and  offered  a  platform  for  digital\nnewspapers, magazines, books, and videos.\niCloud, which demoted the computer from its central role in managing our content\nand let all of our devices sync seamlessly.\n\nAnd  Apple  itself,  which  Jobs  considered  his  greatest  creation,  a  place  where\nimagination was nurtured, applied, and executed in ways so creative that it became\nthe most valuable company on earth.\nWas he smart? No, not exceptionally. Instead, he was a genius. His imaginative leaps\nwere instinctive, unexpected, and at times magical. He was, indeed, an example of what\nthe mathematician Mark Kac called a magician genius, someone whose insights come\nout of the blue and require intuition more than mere mental processing power. Like a\npathfinder, he could absorb information, sniff the winds, and sense what lay ahead.\nSteve Jobs thus became the greatest business executive of our era, the one most\ncertain to be remembered a century from now. History will place him in the pantheon\nright next to Edison and Ford. More than anyone else of his time, he made products that\nwere completely innovative, combining the power of poetry and processors. With a\nferocity that could make working with him as unsettling as it was inspiring, he also built\nthe world’s most creative company. And he was able to infuse into its DNA the design\nsensibilities, perfectionism, and imagination that make it likely to be, even decades\nfrom now, the company that thrives best at the intersection of artistry and technology.\nAnd One More Thing ...\nBiographers are supposed to have the last word. But this is a biography of Steve Jobs.\nEven though he did not impose his legendary desire for control on this project, I suspect\nthat I would not be conveying the right feel for him—the way he asserted himself in any\nsituation—if I just shuffled him onto history’s stage without letting him have some last\nwords.\nOver the course of our conversations, there were many times when he reflected on\nwhat he hoped his legacy would be. Here are those thoughts, in his own words:\nMy passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to\nmake great products. Everything else was secondary. Sure, it was great to make a profit,\nbecause that was what allowed you to make great products. But the products, not the\nprofits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to\nmake money. It’s a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything: the people you\nhire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in meetings.\nSome people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach.\nOur job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford\nonce said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster\n\nhorse!’” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I\nnever rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.\nEdwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science. I\nlike that intersection. There’s something magical about that place. There are a lot of\npeople innovating, and that’s not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple\nresonates with people is that there’s a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think\ngreat artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express\nthemselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and\nmusicians on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express\ntheir creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great\nat science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a\nsculptor.\nPeople pay us to integrate things for them, because they don’t have the time to think\nabout this stuff 24/7. If you have an extreme passion for producing great products, it\npushes you to be integrated, to connect your hardware and your software and content\nmanagement. You want to break new ground, so you have to do it yourself. If you want\nto allow your products to be open to other hardware or software, you have to give up\nsome of your vision.\nAt different times in the past, there were companies that exemplified Silicon Valley.\nIt was Hewlett-Packard for a long time. Then, in the semiconductor era, it was Fairchild\nand Intel. I think that it was Apple for a while, and then that faded. And then today, I\nthink it’s Apple and Google—and a little more so Apple. I think Apple has stood the\ntest of time. It’s been around for a while, but it’s still at the cutting edge of what’s going\non.\nIt’s easy to throw stones at Microsoft. They’ve clearly fallen from their dominance.\nThey’ve become mostly irrelevant. And yet I appreciate what they did and how hard it\nwas. They were very good at the business side of things. They were never as ambitious\nproduct-wise as they should have been. Bill likes to portray himself as a man of the\nproduct,  but  he’s  really  not.  He’s  a  businessperson.  Winning  business  was  more\nimportant than making great products. He ended up the wealthiest guy around, and if that\nwas his goal, then he achieved it. But it’s never been my goal, and I wonder, in the end,\nif  it  was  his  goal.  I  admire  him  for  the  company  he  built—it’s  impressive—and  I\nenjoyed working with him. He’s bright and actually has a good sense of humor. But\nMicrosoft never had the humanities and liberal arts in its DNA. Even when they saw the\nMac, they couldn’t copy it well. They totally didn’t get it.\nI have  my  own  theory  about  why  decline  happens  at  companies  like  IBM  or\nMicrosoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close\nto it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The\ncompany starts valuing the great salesmen, because they’re the ones who can move the\nneedle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up\nrunning the company. John Akers at IBM was a smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson,\n\nbut he didn’t know anything about product. The same thing happened at Xerox. When the\nsales guys run the company, the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just\nturn  off.  It  happened  at  Apple  when  Sculley  came  in,  which  was  my  fault,  and  it\nhappened when Ballmer took over at Microsoft. Apple was lucky and it rebounded, but\nI don’t think anything will change at Microsoft as long as Ballmer is running it.\nI hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really\ntrying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move\non. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the\nhardest work in business. That’s how you really make a contribution and add to the\nlegacy  of  those  who  went  before.  You  build  a  company  that  will  still  stand  for\nsomething a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did, and Hewlett and\nPackard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to\nmake money. That’s what I want Apple to be.\nI don’t think I run roughshod over people, but if something sucks, I tell people to\ntheir face. It’s my job to be honest. I know what I’m talking about, and I usually turn out\nto be right. That’s the culture I tried to create. We are brutally honest with each other,\nand anyone can tell me they think I am full of shit and I can tell them the same. And\nwe’ve had some rip-roaring arguments, where we are yelling at each other, and it’s\nsome of the best times I’ve ever had. I feel totally comfortable saying “Ron, that store\nlooks like shit” in front of everyone else. Or I might say “God, we really fucked up the\nengineering on this” in front of the person that’s responsible. That’s the ante for being in\nthe room: You’ve got to be able to be super honest. Maybe there’s a better way, a\ngentlemen’s club where we all wear ties and speak in this Brahmin language and velvet\ncode-words, but I don’t know that way, because I am middle class from California.\nI was hard on people sometimes, probably harder than I needed to be. I remember\nthe time when Reed was six years old, coming home, and I had just fired somebody that\nday, and I imagined what it was like for that person to tell his family and his young son\nthat he had lost his job. It was hard. But somebody’s got to do it. I figured that it was\nalways my job to make sure that the team was excellent, and if I didn’t do it, nobody\nwas going to do it.\nYou always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs\nforever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t. He had to move on, and when\nhe did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour\nwas his greatest. He would come on and do a set of acoustic guitar, and the audiences\nloved him. Then he brought out what became The Band, and they would all do an\nelectric set, and the audience sometimes booed. There was one point where he was\nabout to sing “Like a Rolling Stone” and someone from the audience yells “Judas!” And\nDylan then says, “Play it fucking loud!” And they did. The Beatles were the same way.\nThey kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That’s what I’ve always tried to do—\nkeep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you’re not busy being born, you’re busy\ndying.\n\nWhat drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being\nable to take advantage of the work that’s been done by others before us. I didn’t invent\nthe language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own\nclothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that\nwe stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add\nsomething to the flow. It’s about trying to express something in the only way that most of\nus know how—because we can’t write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try\nto use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of\nall the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That’s what\nhas driven me.\nCoda\nOne sunny afternoon, when he wasn’t feeling well, Jobs sat in the garden behind his\nhouse and reflected on death. He talked about his experiences in India almost four\ndecades earlier, his study of Buddhism, and his views on reincarnation and spiritual\ntranscendence. “I’m about fifty-fifty on believing in God,” he said. “For most of my life,\nI’ve felt that there must be more to our existence than meets the eye.”\nHe admitted that, as he faced death, he might be overestimating the odds out of a\ndesire to believe in an afterlife. “I like to think that something survives after you die,”\nhe said. “It’s strange to think that you accumulate all this experience, and maybe a little\nwisdom, and it just goes away. So I really want to believe that something survives, that\nmaybe your consciousness endures.”\nHe fell silent for a very long time. “But on the other hand, perhaps it’s like an on-off\nswitch,” he said. “Click! And you’re gone.”\nThen he paused again and smiled slightly. “Maybe that’s why I never liked to put on-\noff switches on Apple devices.”\n\nEPILOGUE\nIn the summer of 2011, when he still thought that he would win another round in his\nbattle against cancer, Steve Jobs suggested to me that I conclude this book with his\nresignation as Apple’s CEO, which he planned to announce late that August. I had\nalready given my publisher a draft of the manuscript, minus the ending. Just before I\nturned in the final revisions, I spent time with Jobs going over a lot of the stories that I\nused, including some that I thought he might not like. He had insisted that I write an\nunvarnished portrayal, so there were many anecdotes about his rough edges. I assured\nhim that I had tried to put them into context, as one aspect of a complex and passionate\npersonality that allowed him to change the world by believing that the ordinary rules\ndidn’t apply to him.\nHe was sanguine. He knew that he was not going down in history as the epitome of\npoliteness, and it was better for him, he said, if the book didn’t read like an officially\nsanctioned account. He told me that he would wait a while, maybe a year, before\nreading it. His confidence, or reality distortion field, was so strong that I was elated.\nFor a moment I believed that he would be around in a year and would get the chance to\nread this book. He seemed so sure that he was going to regain his health and resume\nbeing active at Apple that I asked if he thought I should hold off publishing and see what\nhappened. “No,” he replied. “If I do something else amazing, that means you get to write\na second volume.” He smiled at that thought, then added, “Or at least a very long\nepilogue.”\nSadly, this is a short epilogue.\nOn Monday, October 3, 2011, Steve Jobs realized that his time had come. He stopped\ntalking about “making it to the next lily pad” in his effort to outrun his cancer and\ninstead shifted his thoughts—with the suddenness that was typical whenever he changed\nhis focus—to his impending death.\n\nHe had not before spoken about his funeral arrangements, and Laurene had assumed\nthat he would want to be cremated. Over the years they had discussed, in an offhand\nmanner,  where  they  might  like  their  ashes  to  be  scattered.  But  on  that  Monday  he\ndeclared that he did not like the idea of his body being cremated. He wanted to be\nburied in the cemetery near his parents.\nTuesday morning, Apple was introducing the new iPhone 4S with the Siri voice-\nrecognition software that Steve had toyed with at his final board meeting. It was a\nrelatively somber affair in the modest Town Hall Auditorium on the Apple campus;\nSteve’s closest colleagues knew that he was doing badly. As soon as the event ended,\nJony Ive, Eddy Cue, Tim Cook, and a few others got the phone call: Come to the house.\nAnd so that afternoon they did, taking their turns saying goodbye.\nJobs called his sister Mona Simpson that day and told her to hurry to Palo Alto. As\nshe recalled in her eulogy, “His tone was affectionate, dear, loving, but like someone\nwhose  luggage  was  already  strapped  onto  the  vehicle,  who  was  already  on  the\nbeginning of his journey, even as he was sorry, truly deeply sorry, to be leaving us.” He\nbegan saying farewell to her, but she said she was in a taxi to the airport and would be\nthere soon. “I’m telling you now because I’m afraid you won’t make it on time, honey,”\nJobs  replied.  His  daughter  Lisa  flew  in  from  New  York;  despite  their  uneven\nrelationship over the years, she had always tried to be a good daughter, and she was.\nHis sister Patty was there as well.\nAnd thus it was that at the end, Steve Jobs was surrounded by a deeply loving\nfamily. He may not always have seemed like the best family man, as he often admitted.\nBut any judgments must take into account results. As a business leader, he could be\ndemanding and temperamental, but he forged a fanatically loyal team of colleagues, who\nloved him dearly. Likewise, as a family man, he could be abrupt and distracted, but he\nhad a marriage that was a deeply romantic full partnership with a strong woman, and he\nproduced four well-grounded children who surrounded him with love at the end. That\nTuesday afternoon, he kept staring into his children’s eyes. At one point he looked at\nPatty and his children for a long time, then at Laurene, and finally gazed past them into\nthe distance. “Oh wow,” he said. “Oh wow. Oh wow.”\nThose were his final words before he drifted into unconsciousness sometime around\ntwo  that  afternoon.  His  breathing  became  heavy.  “Even  now,  he  had  a  stern,  still\nhandsome profile, the profile of an absolutist, a romantic,” Mona recalled. “His breath\nindicated an arduous journey, some steep path, altitude.” She and Laurene stayed up\nwith him through the night. The next day—Wednesday, October 5, 2011—Steve Jobs\ndied, with members of his family around him, touching him.\nThe  news  of  his  death  unleashed  an  emotional  outpouring  around  the  world.\nImpromptu shrines were constructed in hundreds of cities and villages, even in Zuccotti\nPark, where Occupy Wall Street activists were protesting the malefactions of billionaire\nbusinessmen. It was fitting. Emotional outpourings are too often reserved for the deaths\nof  drug-numbed  rock  stars  and  troubled  princesses.  It  was  refreshing  to  see  an\n\nentrepreneur celebrated. He may have been a billionaire businessman, but he became so\nby crafting beautiful products that made lives more magical.\nThe day after Jobs died, Laurene and Mona went to the cemetery he had chosen and\nwere driven around in a golf cart. There were no plots available next to those of Paul\nand Clara Jobs, and Laurene hated the other options that she was shown, where the\nheadstones were crammed into rows on an undistinguished, flat piece of land. But like\nher husband, she was imaginative and willful. She pointed to a bucolic ridge crowned\nby one of the area’s last remaining apricot orchards, the type of grove that Jobs had\nloved from his childhood. It wasn’t available, she was told. There were no plans or\npermits to put burial plots there. That did not deter her. After much insistence, she\nconvinced the cemetery director that her husband would eventually have his final resting\nplace near the orchard. Steve would have been proud of her.\nLaurene was able, then as always, to combine her husband’s pristine taste with her\nown loving grace. The casket she had made was perfectly crafted and hinged, with no\nnails or screws. Pure and simple. At the private burial ceremony, it rested on one of the\ngray industrial tables from the serene design studio at Apple headquarters, where Jobs\nhad spent so many afternoons. Jony Ive had arranged for the table to be brought to the\ngrave-side. There were fifty or so family members and friends in attendance, and some\nchose to share stories. Disney’s Bob Iger, for example, told of taking a walk with Jobs\naround  the  Pixar  campus  just  thirty  minutes  before  the  deal  with  Disney  to  be\nannounced. Jobs told him that his cancer had returned, and only Laurene and the doctors\nknew; he felt he had a duty to let Iger know in case he wanted to pull out of the deal. “It\nwas an extraordinary gesture on his part,” Iger said.\nA formal memorial service was held on the evening of October 16 in Stanford’s\nMemorial Church, which was bathed in candlelight for the occasion. Laurene and Jony\nIve had worked together to get the look perfect. Among the hundred or so guests were\nBill Clinton, Al Gore, Bill Gates, and Larry Page. From the past were members of the\nearly  Apple  team,  including  Steve  Wozniak  and  Andy  Hertzfeld.  Family  members\nincluded his children and his sisters, Patty Jobs and Mona Simpson.\n“Steve wanted me to play cello at his funeral,” Yo-Yo Ma said as the service began,\n“and I said I would prefer he speak at mine. As usual, he got his way.” Ma played a\nBach suite. Two other friends also performed. Bono sang “Every Grain of Sand.” One\nof Jobs’s Bob Dylan favorites. In the fury of the moment I can see the master’s hand,\nIn  every  leaf  that  trembles,  in  every  grain  of  sand. Joan Baez sang the mournful yet\nuplifting spiritual, “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.”\nEach member of the family recounted a few stories or read a poem. “His mind was\nnever a captive of reality,” Laurene said. “He possessed an epic sense of possibility.\nHe looked at things from the standpoint of perfection.”\nMona Simpson, as befitting a novelist, had a finely crafted eulogy. “He was an\nintensely emotional man,” she recalled. “Even ill, his taste, his discrimination and his\njudgment held. He went through sixty-seven nurses before finding kindred spirits.” She\n\nspoke of her brother’s love of work and noted that “even in the last year, he embarked\nupon projects and elicited promises from his friends at Apple to finish them.” She also,\nmore personally, stressed his love of Laurene and all four of his children. Although he\nhad  achieved  his  wish  of  living  to  see  Reed’s  graduation,  he  would  not  see  his\ndaughters’ weddings. “He’d wanted to walk them down the aisle as he’d walked me the\nday of my wedding,” she said. Those chapters would not be written. “We all—in the\nend—die in media res. In the middle of a story. Of many stories.”\nThe corporate memorial on the Apple campus was held three days later. Tim Cook,\nAl Gore, and Bill Campbell all spoke, but Jony Ive stole the show with a tribute both\namusing and emotional. He told the story, as he had at the Stanford memorial, of Jobs\nbeing so finicky that whenever they checked into a hotel Ive would sit by the phone\nwaiting for the inevitable call from him saying, “This hotel sucks, let’s go.” But Ive also\ncaptured the scattershot brilliance at the core of Jobs’s genius when he described his\nboss tossing out ideas at a meeting. “Sometimes they were dopey. Sometimes they were\ntruly  dreadful.  But  sometimes  they  took  the  air  from  the  room  ...  bold,  crazy,\nmagnificent ideas, or quiet simply ones which, in the subtlety, their detail, were utterly\nprofound.”\nThe highlight of the service came from Jobs himself, speaking like a ghost hovering\nover the sunny courtyard. Cook introduced him by describing how Jobs had helped to\ncraft the “Think Different” commercial when he was restored to Apple in 1997. For the\nfirst time, the unused version that Jobs himself recorded—rather than the one read by\nRichard Dreyfuss—was played in public. From the loudspeakers came his distinctive\nvoice, poignant and jarring as it wafted over the crowd. “Here’s to the crazy ones. The\nmisfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones\nwho  see  things  differently.”  It  felt  as  if  Jobs  were  back  with  them,  earnest  and\nemotional, describing himself. “They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for\nthe status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the\nonly thing you can’t do is ignore them.” At that point his voice became slightly more\nemphatic, excited, as if he were sitting right in front of the crowd, his eyes again ablaze.\nIt conjured up memories of what he sounded like when he was young, and how, as in his\nfavorite  Dylan  song,  he  had  remained  forever  young.  “They  push  the  human  race\nforward.” That was a line he had written himself. And then he delivered the famous\nsummation, as fitting for that day as it is for this book. “While some may see them as the\ncrazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can\nchange the world are the ones who do.”\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI’m deeply  grateful  to  John  and  Ann  Doerr,  Laurene  Powell,  Mona  Simpson,  Leon\nWieseltier,  and  Ken  Auletta,  all  of  whom  provided  invaluable  support  along  the  way.\nAlice  Mayhew,  who  has  been  my  editor  at  Simon  &  Schuster  for  thirty  years,  and\nJonathan  Karp,  the  publisher,  both  were  extraordinarily  diligent  and  attentive  in\nshepherding  this  book,  as  was  Amanda  Urban,  my  agent.  Crary  Pullen  was  dogged  in\ntracking  down  photos,  and  my  assistant,  Pat  Zindulka,  calmly  facilitated  things.  I  also\nwant to thank my father, Irwin, and my daughter, Betsy, for reading the book and offering\nadvice.  When  the  original  version  of  this  book  came  out,  it  caused  some  wounded\nfeelings,  which  was  probably  inevitable  given  what  a  complicated  and  extraordinary\nman Jobs was. For that I am sorry. It was not my intention. I am grateful to those who\nhave  been  forgiving  of  my  lapses  and  misperceptions  and  who  have  helped  me  make\ncorrections or clear a few things up.

How many of you have taken LSD?”\nWith the Lisa: “Picasso had a saying—‘good artists copy, great artists steal’—and we\nhave always been shameless about stealing great ideas.”\n\nWith John Sculley in Central Park, 1984: “Do you want to spend the rest of your life\nselling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?”\nIn his Apple office, 1982: Asked if he wanted to do market research, he said, “No,\nbecause customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.”\n\nAt NeXT, 1988: Freed from the constraints at Apple, he indulged his own best and\nworst instincts.\nWith John Lasseter, August 1997: His cherubic face and demeanor masked an artistic\nperfectionism that rivaled that of Jobs.\n\nAt home working on his Boston Macworld speech after regaining command of Apple,\n1997: “In that craziness we see genius.”\n\nSealing the Microsoft deal by phone with Gates: “Bill, thank you for your support of\nthis company. I think the world’s a better place for it.”\n\nAt Boston Macworld, as Gates discusses their deal: “That was my worst and stupidest\nstaging event ever. It made me look small.”\nWith his wife, Laurene Powell, in their backyard in Palo Alto, August 1997: She was\nthe sensible anchor in his life.\n\nAt his home office in Palo Alto, 2004: “I like living at the intersection of the humanities\nand technology.”\nFrom the Jobs Family Album\nIn August 2011, when Jobs was very ill, we sat in his room and went through wedding\nand vacation pictures for me to use in this book.\nThe wedding ceremony, 1991: Kobun Chino, Steve’s St Zen teacher, shook a stick,\nstruck a gong, lit incense, and chanted.\n\nWith his proud father Paul Jobs: After Steve’s sister Mona tracked down their\nbiological father, Steve refused ever to meet him.\n\nCutting the cake in the shape of Half Dome with Laurene and his daughter from a\nprevious relationship, Lisa Brennan.\nLaurene, Lisa, and Steve: Lisa moved into their home shortly afterward and stayed\nthrough her high school years.\nSteve, Eve, Reed, Erin, and Laurene in Ravello, Italy, 2003: Even on vacation, he often\nwithdrew into his work.\n\nDangling Eve in Foothills Park, Palo Alto: “She’s a pistol and has the strongest will of\nany kid I’ve ever met. It’s like payback.”\n\nWith Laurene, Eve, Erin, and Lisa at the Corinth Canal in Greece, 2006: “For young\npeople, this whole world is the same now.”\n\nWith Erin in Kyoto, 2010: Like Reed and Lisa, she got a special trip to Japan with her\nfather.\n\nWith Reed in Kenya, 2007: “When I was diagnosed with cancer, I made my deal with\nGod or whatever, which was that I really wanted to see Reed graduate.”\nAnd just one more from Diana Walker: a 2004 portrait at his house in Palo Alto.\n\n\n\n* Raskin died of pancreatic cancer in 2005, not long after Jobs was diagnosed with the\ndisease.\n\n* The firm changed its name from frogdesign to frog design in 2000 and moved to San\nFrancisco. Esslinger picked the original name not merely because frogs have the ability\nto metamorphose, but as a salute to its roots in the (f)ederal (r)epublic (o)f (g)ermany.\nHe  said  that  “the  lowercase  letters  offered  a  nod  to  the  Bauhaus  notion  of  a  non-\nhierarchical language, reinforcing the company’s ethos of democratic partnership.”",

    "content": "The Art of Programming\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Programming\n\nProgramming is the art of instructing computers to perform specific tasks. It involves writing code in various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++. Each language has its own syntax and characteristics that make it suitable for different types of applications.\n\nThe fundamental concepts of programming include:\n\n1. Variables: Storage containers for data values\n2. Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks\n3. Loops: Structures that repeat code execution\n4. Conditionals: Statements that make decisions based on conditions\n5. Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data efficiently\n\nChapter 2: Best Practices\n\nWriting clean, readable code is essential for maintainable software. Some best practices include:\n\n- Use meaningful variable names\n- Write comments to explain complex logic\n- Follow consistent indentation and formatting\n- Test your code thoroughly\n- Break large problems into smaller, manageable functions\n\nChapter 3: Problem Solving\n\nProgramming is fundamentally about problem solving. The key steps in the problem-solving process are:\n\n1. Understand the problem clearly\n2. Break it down into smaller subproblems\n3. Design an algorithm or solution approach\n4. Implement the solution in code\n5. Test and debug the implementation\n6. Optimize for performance if necessary\n\nConclusion\n\nProgramming is both an art and a science. It requires logical thinking, creativity, and attention to detail. With practice and dedication, anyone can become proficient in programming and create software that solves real-world problems.",
